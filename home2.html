<p>
We predict the existence of the proton, its radius and charge as a consequence of space which we show is responsible for inertia, and find everything follows from six-fold symmetry, including the hydrocarbons the skeletons of life. To do this we introduce the idea intermediary mass and shows that one second is a natural unit, not just on the order of the atoms but on the order of the solar system. It follows that the solar system is probably mirroring the atom in that we see it can be described as an equation of state for the Earth-Moon-Sun system that equates to an equation of state for the proton. We introduce the idea of proton-seconds which suggests there might be some use in considering chemical equation as algebraic equations as well. We then present the six-fold nature of the solar system further demonstrating it connection to the atom. </p>

<p>The manifestations of matter from proton mass and radius, and their fields are shown as properties of point, plane, and line that open-up in six-fold symmetry. This is all centered around the life element carbon. We see the planets open up in six-fold symmetry as well. To do our work we introduce a constant k in units of inverse velocity by suggesting the use of an intermediary mass that comes from white dwarf stars. We suggest there is another intermediary mass and k as well based on neutron stars. We suggest that if we want to go further to explain why six-fold symmetry we have to go into the mathematics of symmetry breaking and perturbation theory.</p>

<p>Here we look at cause of causes earlier layer out in 02. A strange story unfolds that seems to be a good lead as to what might be going on surrounding the question of extraterrestrial contact here on earth in modern and ancient times.</p>

<p><a href="SixFold04.html">Click here to read The Basis of the Universe as Six-Fold Symmetry 04 (Updated Jan 08 2023)</a></p>

<p>It would seem at the basis of Nature is six-fold symmetry whether we are talking about biology, like it’s hydrocarbons skeleton, which we do here, or the orbits of the planets. I show the earth is the eigenvalue or characteristic root for the matrix that describes the solar system and to do this I formulate the solar system as six-fold symmetry and suggest this could be taken as a logos, a formulation of the language of Nature. I develop a constant k which is on larger scales compared to Planck’s constant on the quantum scale, and I find it is is necessary to look at the larger scales of chemistry using Avogadro’s number and the velocities of the planets, really to predict the radius of the proton in terms of not just Planck’s constant, but in terms of gravity, G, which takes us into the realm of Quantum Field Theory. Once we establish the idea of proton-seconds we find we can formulate chemical compounds as mathematical, algebraic constructs which is done here. The paper goes from fundamental particles like protons, to atoms, to compounds, and to the planets suggesting perhaps it is all part of the same thing in making up the Universe. Read the paper here, that is a broad sweep of six-fold nature at the basis of the Universe, part of an overall project in process.</p>
