<h1>The Second As A Universal Characteristic Time</h1>

<p>Abstract: I present my findings that show a characteristic time of one second is in a wave solution of the Solar System and the atom’s proton in common. As well I show it describes the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of biological life chemistry. I show the unit of a second is not arbitrary, as history would have it, but rather comes from the wise decision of the ancient Sumerians to have developed an Earth day (rotation period) of 24 hours and a base 60 counting system.</p>

<p>In the expression on the left of the equation:<p>

<p>$$\left(\frac{1}{6\alpha^2}\sqrt{\frac{4\pi h}{Gc}}\right)\cdot\frac{r_p}{m_p}=1second$$<p>

<p>it has units of mass times time divided by the mass of a proton. This means we have divided the mass \(6m_p\) into a mass times a time giving one second. You want it to be like this because I found:

<p>$$\left(\sqrt{\phi\cdot\frac{\pi r_p}{\alpha^4Gm_p^3}}\right)\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{h}{c}=1second$$</p>

<p>Thus we can equate these two equations to get the radius of a proton:

<p>$$r_p=\phi\frac{h}{cm_p}$$</p>

<p>Where \(\phi=0.618\) is the golden ratio. The most recent value is 0.833E-15m. This is very close to the radius of a proton, and may actually be the radius of a proton because \(\phi=0.618\) is the golden ratio which optimizes things in many systems, and the tendency over the years in measuring the proton's size is that it is getting smaller.  The historic value was 0.877E-15m, 4% larger than the current value. That value was measured twice by two different methods a long time ago. I find it can be approximated by introducing the fibonacci ratio of 2/3 that approximates the golden ratio by replacing the golden ratio with it, thus using:</p>

<p>$$r_p=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{h}{cm_p}$$</p>

<p>$$r_p=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{6.62607E-34}{(299,792,458)(1.67262E-27)}=0.88094E-15m$$</p>

<p>The proton is thought not to have a precise radius but rather is changing by small amounts around a central value due to it really being a fuzzy cloud of subatomic particles. Thus</p> 

<p>$$\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{\pi r_p}{\alpha^4Gm_p^3}}\right)\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{h}{c}=1second$$</p>

<p>$$\left(\sqrt{\phi\cdot\frac{\pi r_p}{\alpha^4Gm_p^3}}\right)\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{h}{c}=1second$$</p>

<p>are both close to a second, just the first is a little over a second and the second is just under a second, But let us ask what is</p>

<p>$$\left(\frac{1}{6\alpha^2}\sqrt{\frac{4\pi h}{Gc}}\right)\cdot\frac{r_p}{m_p}=1second$$</p>

<p>It is  action \(h\) or energy over time as it occurs due to the nature of space, reduced by G, the pliability of space, and the speed of light, c, the speed at which things interact, for the size of a proton \(r_p\) and its mass \(m_p\). \(4\pi\) is introduced for the surface area of a proton. We find then, this gives the characteristic time for the proton, which happens to be nicely one second, But why the 6 in \(6m_p\)? Well this says six protons give a characteristic time of one second. This means six protons which is carbon, the core element of life, is described by one second. You want that because it has been found carbon is the most stable element in terms of which to study other elements because a configuration of 6 protons, or six electric fields, comes out mathematically stable. This can be thought of loosely as the six sided figure, a regular hexagon, has its sides equal in length to its radii thus resulting in dynamic stability associated with six-fold symmetry. It is why the bee’s honeycomb is tessellated regular hexagons. The same goes for the six electrons orbiting, and attracted to, the six protons. Thus you want the basis unit of our physics, 1 second, associated with carbon, 6 protons. But further, since you want your physics to be based on  the six-fold you want six seconds to give the proton, or hydrogen atom, because it is the basis unit of chemistry; 1 proton, 1 electron, which it does. We have</p>

 <p>$$\frac{1}{6protons}\cdot\frac{1}{\alpha^2}\cdot\frac{r_p}{m_p}\sqrt{\frac{4\pi h}{Gc}}=1 second$$is carbon (C)</p>

 <p>$$\frac{1}{1proton}\cdot\frac{1}{\alpha^2}\cdot\frac{r_p}{m_p}\sqrt{\frac{4\pi h}{Gc}}=6 seconds$$is hydrogen (H)</p>

<p>A very interesting thing here is, the smallest integer value 1 second produces 6 protons (carbon) and the largest integer value 6 seconds produces one proton (hydrogen). Beyond six seconds you have fractional protons, and the rest of the elements heavier than carbon are formed by fractional seconds. These are the hydrocarbons the backbones of biological life chemistry.</p>

<p>And indeed for our solar system the characteristic time is one second as well. The Planck type constant \(\hbar_\odot\) for the solar system I found is is given by the Earth orbit meaning the Earth quantizes angular momentum for the system</p>

<p>$$\hbar_\odot=(1second)KE_e$$</p>

That is, it is 1 second times the kinetic energy of the Earth. But, the ground state is given by the Moon orbiting the Earth

<p>$$\frac{\hbar_{\odot}^2}{GM_m^3}\cdot\frac{1}{c}=1second$$</p>

<p>Where \(M_m\) is the mass of the Moon. That is,</p> 

<p>$$\frac{\hbar_\odot^2}{GM_m^3}=\frac{(2.8314E33)^2}{(6.67408E-11)(7.34763E22kg)^3}=3.0281E8m$$</p>

<p>is the analogy to the ground state of the hydrogen atom:</p>

$$r_1=\frac{\hbar^2}{ke^2m_e}$$

$$r_1\approx0.529E-10m$$

<p>We know our Planck constant for the Solar System is correct, \(\hbar_\odot\), because we have</p>

<p>$$KE_e=\sqrt{n}\frac{R_\odot}{R_m}\cdot\frac{G^2M_e^2M_m^3}{2\hbar_\odot^2}$$</p>

<p>Is 99.5% accurate, $R_\odot$ the radius of the Sun, $R_m$ the radius of the Moon:</p>

<p>$$E_n=\sqrt{n}\frac{R_\odot}{R_m}\frac{G^2M_e^2M_m^3}{2\hbar_\odot^2}$$</p>

$$\frac{R_\odot}{R_m}=\frac{6.96E8m}{1737400m}=400.5986$$

<p>$$E_3=(1.732)(400.5986)\frac{(6.67408E-11)^2(5.972E24kg)^2(7.347673E22kg)^3}{2(2.8314E33)^2}$$</p>=

<p>=2.727E33J</p>

<p>The kinetic energy of the Earth is</p>

<p>$$KE_e=\frac{1}{2}(5.972E24kg)(30,290m/s)^2=2.7396E33J$$

$$\frac{2.727E33J}{2.7396E33J}100=99.5\%$$

Which is very good, about 100% accuracy for all practical purposes.

$$\frac{R_\odot}{R_m}\rightarrow Z^2$$</p>

<p>The radius of the Sun in lunar radii, plays the role of the number of protons, Z, for the atom. That is for the atom:</p>

<p>$$E_n=-\frac{Z^2(k_ee^2)^2m_e}{2\hbar^2n^2}$$</p>

<p>The characteristic time of about one second gives us, as well, the rotation period of the Earth, 24 hours, in terms the kinetic energies of the Moon and the Earth:</p>

<p>$$\frac{KE_m}{KE_e}(EarthDay)= 1.1-1.3 seconds$$</p>

<p>Earth day=(24)(60)(60)=86,400 seconds. Using the Moon’s orbital velocity at aphelion, and Earth’s orbital velocity at perihelion we have:</p>

<p>$$KE_{moon}=\frac{1}{2}(7.347673E22kg)(966m/s)^2=3.428E28J$$</p>

<p>$$KE_{earth}=\frac{1}{2}(5.972E24kg)(30,290m/s)^2=2.7396E33J$$</p>

<p>Even though the second came to us historically because the ancient Sumerians divided the Earth day (rotation period) into 24 hours, and because each hour and minute got further divisions by 60 because of their base 60 counting system by the ancient Babylonians that inherited it from the ancient Sumerians, the division is not arbitrary, and hence neither is the second, because I have found this system is given by the rotational angular momentum of the Earth in terms the solar system Planck-type constant:</p>

<p>$$\frac{L_{earth}}{\hbar_\odot}24=60$$</p>

<p>$$L_{earth}=\frac{4}{5}\pi M_ef_eR_e^2$$

Where the angular momentum, $L_{earth}$, is given by the mass of the Earth, the size of the Earth, and its rotation frequency.</p>

The value is 2.5 which by modeling our Solar System is found to be the exponent in the pressure gradient for the protoplanetary disc from which our Solar System formed. That is I found

<p>$$P(R)=P_0\left(\frac{R}{R_0}\right)^{-\frac{L_{earth}}{\hbar_\odot}}$$</p>

<p>the pressure of the disc as a function of radius. Which suggests that the structure of the protoplanetary disc could be governed by the same fundamental time of one second in the Earth’s rotation and that the Earth’s formation process may be encoded in the same number we developed since ancient times to describe time (24, 60).  This is the solution to:</p>

<p>$$\frac{dP}{dr}=-\rho\left(\frac{GM_\star}{r^2}-\frac{v_\phi^2}{r}\right)$$</p>

<p>The protoplanetary disc that evolves into the planets has two forces that balance its pressure, the centripetal force of the gas disc due to its rotation around the protostar \(v_\phi^2/r\) and the inward gravitational force on the disc from the protostar \(GM_\star/r^2\), and these are related by \(\rho\) the density of the gas that makes up the disc. It is the pressure gradient of the disc in radial equilibrium balancing the inward gravity and outward centripetal force. In order to apply this to other star systems, we have to be able to predict the radius of the habitable planet, presumably in the n=3 orbit. I found the answer to be in the Vedic literature of India. They noticed that the diameter of the Sun is about 108 times the diameter of the Earth and that the average distance from the Sun to the Earth is about 108 solar diameters, with 108 being a significant number in Yoga. So I wrote the equivalent:</p>

<p>$$R_{planet}=2\frac{R_\star^2}{r_{planet}}$$</p>

<p>The surprising result I found was, after applying it to the stars of many spectral types, with their different radii and luminosities (the luminosities determine \(r_{planet}\) the distances to the habitable zones) that the radius of the planet always came out about the same, about the radius of the Earth. This may suggest optimally habitable planets are not just a function of the distance from the star, which determines their temperature, but are functions of their size and mass probably because it is good for life chemistry. Here are just a few examples using the data for several spectral types:</p>

<p>F8V Star
Mass: 1.18
Radius: 1.221
Luminosity: 1.95
$$M_\star=1.18(1.9891E30kg)=2.347E30kg$$
$$R_\star=1.221(6.9634E8m)=8.5023E8m$$
$$r_p=\sqrt{1.95L_\odot}AU=1.3964AU(1.496E11m/AU)=2.08905E11m$$
$$R_p=\frac{2R_\star^2}{r_p}=2\frac{(8.5023E8m)^2}{2.08905E11m}=\frac{6.92076E6m}{6.378E6m}=1.0851EarthRadii$$</p>

<p>F9V Star
Mass: 1.13
Radius: 1.167
Luminosity: 1.66
$$M_\star=1.13(1.9891E30kg)=2.247683E30kg$$
$$R_\star=1.167(6.9634E8m)=8.1262878E8m$$
$$r_p=\sqrt{1.66L_\odot}AU=1.28841AU(1.496E11m/AU)=1.92746E11m$$
$$R_p=\frac{2R_\star^2}{r_p}=2\frac{(8.1262878E8m)^2}{1.92746E11m}=\frac{6.852184E6m}{6.378E6m}=1.0743468EarthRadii$$</p>


<p>G0V Star
Mass: 1.06
Radius: 1.100
Luminosity: 1.35
$$M_\star=1.06(1.9891E30kg)=2.108446E30kg$$
$$R_\star=1.100(6.9634E8m)=7.65974E8m$$
$$r_p=\sqrt{1.35L_\odot}AU=1.161895AU(1.496E11m/AU)=1.7382E11m$$
$$R_p=\frac{2R_\star^2}{r_p}=2\frac{7.65974E8m)^2}{1.7382E11m}=\frac{6.751E6m}{6.378E6m}=1.05848EarthRadii$$</p>

<p>As you can see we consistently get about 1 Earth radius for the radius of every planet in the habitable zone of each type of star. It might be that radius is right for life in terms of gravity and densities for the elements. I got these results for the stars from spectral types F5V to K3V.</p>

<p>In order to get \(r_{planet}\), the distance of the habitable planet from the star, we use the inverse square law for luminosity of the star. If the Earth is in the habitable zone, and if the star is one hundred times brighter than the Sun, then by the inverse square law the distance to the habitable zone of the planet is 10 times that of what the Earth is from the Sun. Thus we have in astronomical units the habitable zone of a star is given by:</p>

<p>$$r_{planet}=\sqrt{\frac{L_\star}{L_\odot}}AU$$</p>

<p>Also, the theory utilizes the fact that the Moon as seen from the Earth perfectly eclipses the Sun as a possible condition for optimal habitability of the planet, which is</p>

<p>$$\frac{r_{planet}}{r_{moon}}=\frac{R_{star}}{R_{moon}}$$</p>

<p>Orbital radius of the planet to that of the moon is radius of the star to that of the moon. It is known that the Moon has a lot to do with the conditions for life on Earth being good because its orbit holds the Earth at its inclination to the Sun its orbit preventing temperature extremes and allowing for the seasons. 

It may be the ancient Sumerians accidentally gave us the second, which turns out to be Natural, not arbitrary, because they chose base 60 as their counting system because it was evenly divisible by the first six integers1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the smallest number that does this, and this is to introduce six-fold symmetry that is a heart of stable dynamics.</p>

<p>How we derive the solar system Planck-type constant:</p>

<p>$$\hbar_\odot=(hC)KE_e$$</p>

<p>$$hC=1second $$</p>

<p>Where</p>

$$C=\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{\alpha^2c}\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{\pi r_p}{Gm_p^3}}$$


<p>$$C=\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{\alpha^2c}\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{2\pi r_p}{Gm_p^3}}$$=</p>

<p>$$\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{18769}{299792458}\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{2\pi(0.833E-15)}{(6.67408E-11)(1.67262E-27)^3}}$$</p>

<p>=$$1.55976565E33$$</p>

<p>=$$\frac{s}{m}\sqrt{\frac{m}{kg^3}\cdot\frac{s^2kg}{m^3}}=\frac{s}{m}\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{kg^2m^2}}=\frac{s}{m}\cdot\frac{s}{kg\cdot m}=\frac{1}{kg}\cdot\frac{s^2}{m^2}$$</p>

$$\frac{1}{C}=kg\frac{m^2}{s^2}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=energy$$

<p>$$hC=(6.62607E-34)(1.55976565E33)=1.03351seconds\approx1.0seconds$$</p>

<p>$$hC=\left(kg\frac{m}{s^2}\cdot m\cdot s\right)\left(\frac{1}{kg}\cdot\frac{s^2}{m^2}\right)$$</p>

<p>=$$\left(kg\frac{m^2}{s}\right)\left(\frac{1}{kg}\cdot\frac{s^2}{m^2}\right)=seconds$$</p>

<p>$$KE_{earth}=\frac{1}{2}(5.972E24kg)(30,290m/s)^2=2.7396E33J$$</p>

<p>$$\hbar_\odot=(hC)KE_{earth}=(1.03351s)(2.7396E33J)=2.8314E33J\cdot s$$</p>
