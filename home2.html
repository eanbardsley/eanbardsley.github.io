<p>If the human mind is honest with itself it is not unreasonable for it to say that it perceives the Universe exists, and as well for it to say existence is impossible. Since these two contradict one another, one has to conclude that the human mind is inherently of understanding reality, that something is very wrong. It may be that the brain, which creates the mind, is not evolved enough to understand reality.</p>

<p>Let us open this up, for there to be something it had to come from nothing uncaused, because every cause needs a cause, yet according to the human mind everything needs and cause, and and because of the this there once had to be nothing, but it is impossible to reason an uncaused cause. Since the mind cannot go beyond this, and there is a universe, the mind is not adequate to make sense.</p>

<p>But if there is a Universe, it may be that it is not what the mind perceives it to be. Reason is a tool for modeling reality and it helps us to survive, but does not tell us what reality is. Mathematics and physics is the ultimate method of reason. Let us look at how they do not tell us what reality is…</p>

<p>What is space and time? We don’t know, it is our starting point and is not described by anything. For instance what is velocity? It is the change in distance with time, meters per second (m/s). Let us write velocity:</p>

<p>Equation 1.    v=x/t</p>

<p>But what is the distance x? It is velocity over time, that is how we define it.  Let’s write that:</p>

<p>Equation 2.     x=vt</p>

<p>Let’s put our value of velocity into equation 2:</p>

<p>x=(x/t)t</p>

<p>We have t cancels with t leaving x=x meaning distance is distance, so we have not said anything about distance (spacial extension in one of the dimensions). We can in fact put all of the relationships between mass, length, and time in any equation in physics and it will return</p>

<p>mass=mass</p>

<p>distance=distance</p>

<p>time=time</p>

<p>So in the end we may have formally written out for instance an equation for gravity that will land us on the Moon, but the equation reduces to saying nothing about what reality actually is. We can theorize what space, mass, and time are, but in the end these theories will result in the same circles as above because they will just create new starting points that need to be explained. Reality is an infinite regress.</p>

<p>If we introduce a God to explain how reality got started from nothing, then we have the problem of how did god get started from nothing. The Universe is impossible, our own existence is impossible, the universe and our existence need causes and those causes need causes, and the causes of those causes need causes and so on in an infinite regress. If the universe, or God had always been there, uncaused for an eternity, that explains nothing because why is it the way it is, why had it always been such that matter has the property of protons that have the masses and sizes they do that make-up everything as opposed to another way, where the universe would fly apart, which it would do if these things were different than they were.</p>

<p>Thus we come to the French Mathematician Rene Descartes, he said “I think, therefore I am”. It seems to me I think, but I can’t explain what I am, that I can’t even explain how I could possibly be, how I could have something from nothing uncaused. Indeed psychiatry does not know what creates the mind because if you trace it back you end-up in paradox. The mind arises from chemistry and neurons firing. But what causes a neuron to fire? The atoms that make-up the neurons are described by quantum mechanics, but as its main founder NIels Bohr said of it, if you haven’t realized that everything that makes-up reality can’t be considered real, you have missed the whole point of quantum mechanics. This is where Einstein, unhappy with the indeterministic natural of reality put forward by quantum mechanics famously said “God doesn’t play dice with the universe”, because we never know when that neuron will fire, there is just a probability, but it can go in a another direction for no discernible reason, this is built into quantum mechanics with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle; we can’t measure reality at the quantum level without affecting the outcome of the experiment, that the observer cannot be separated from the observed. In other words, in looking at the brain and how it works, we look at the chemistry, and to describe the chemistry we have to look at the atoms, which is where we run in to quantum mechanics telling us none of it is real.</p>

<p>Thus if we can’t have an uncaused cause, yet have existence, God has to transcend this and we are left with God is not something the human mind can’t describe. I think this is why religions put him in terms of something we understand, even though this description does not resolve the paradox. We put him in a beard for wisdom, a staff for knowledge, a robe for universality, But as our existence is inconceivable, so must be the the Nature of God what ever such an entity might be. And why a male? The Torah, from which we get the Old Testament of the Bible originally held that God had a wife, her name was Ashara, but she was eventually written out of the the Torah, but there are a few sects in the world today that still include her. That may be a better symbology because creation is a product of the union of Man and Woman, and it seems she was eventually written out of the Torah as usual, due to politics, to put woman in a lower position to have her subservient. Why one God, why not something like a council, or board of trustees? God or no God, Gods or no Gods, the whole thing, reality, seems simultaneously present yet impossible.</p>

<p>It is difficult to detect planets around stars other than the Sun, because the planets are so small and only shine by reflected light and the stars are so bright that they easily wash them out. However we have done it allot with both the method of transit, and by detecting a wobble in the star from the planet tugging on it, by looking at small doppler shifts in the star due to its motion from the wobble. However, we want to detect Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of  yellow spectral class G stars like our Sun, and it is easiest with large gas giants like Jupiter further from the star and with enough size to make a noticeable drop in the light of the star due to a transit (due to the planet passing in front of the star). For Earth-sized planets we have detected the first, but around a cool, red dwarf spectral class M star. We find a lot of planets around M type stars and this is because they are smaller and fainter meaning a transit is more noticeable because a larger percent of the light is dimmed. As well because these stars are cooler, the habitable zone is closer in, and thus the orbital period is shorter, about a month compared to 365 days. For an orbit of 365 days we would have to measure the star’s brightness for 365 days, and do this about 3 times to verify there is an Earth-sized planet orbiting it. Red dwarf spectral class M stars are the most populous in our galaxy, and they might have life, but one could speculate the conditions would not be very good for complex intelligent life because the planets in their habitable zones are usually probably tidally locked because they are so close in to the star, that due to gravity from the star they end up with a day as long as their year meaning they always have one face to the star like with our moon orbiting the Earth. There would be one-side where it is always daytime and the other side where it is always night, meaning life would more than likely happen on the twilight zone where night meets day. We really want to find Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of yellow spectral class G stars like our Sun. This occurs where the planet is not too close in or too far out, so that the temperature is right for water to be liquid.</p>

<p>However, I have found a way of theorizing that habitable planets don’t just exist around yellow stars like our Sun, but that they are perhaps a natural property of the Universe. I do this by suggesting star systems mirror the atom and have a solution to the wave equation we use to model the atom. The result is that our solar system for which we have data, is a solution of the wave equation in terms of the protons that make it up. Since protons have the same properties throughout the Universe, I can propose that such habitable star systems may be a property of the Universe. The James Webb telescope is being prepared for the search for Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of yellow stars like the our Sun, it is even being prepared to try and photograph them (detect them directly) and to do spectroscopy on them to determine the compositions of their atmospheres. So I may have the data I need to see if my findings extend throughout the Universe, at least throughout our our galaxy.</p>

<p>A strange occurrence in my theory is that the equations are based around the duration of 1 second. I say strange because this means the second is a natural unit, but it was not designed as such. It came from ancient times, from the Sumerians who first settled down from hunting with stone spearpoints and invent agriculture, writing, mathematics, and government. We got the 60 minute hour and 60 second minute from them because they chose base 60 counting for their mathematics, probably because it is so evenly divisible by so much. This went to the Babylonians, and then to the Ancient Greeks, who first started cataloging the stars, and measuring the Earth day, lunar month, solar year, and motions of the planets that we use in the western tradition. It is a mystery in archaeology and anthropology, what caused the Sumerians to settle down from hunting with stone spearpoints and to begin smelting metal for tools, and firing clay to make homes, because on an anthropological time-scale it happened almost overnight, so there have been those who have suggested their knowledge was given to them by visitors from space.</p>

<p>The idea that life is part of a cosmic process is not new. The British astronomer Fred Hoyle suggested the idea that in the formation of stars and planets life was seeded throughout the Universe with a common seed in his Panspermia theory. To do this, since life as we know it is based on carbon he had to show how stars make carbon, which he is credited with having discovered in his triple-alpha process. Astrobiology, also called exobiology has been a science for some time now, which treats biology of not just the Earth but as a phenomenon throughout the universe. Now the subject has textbooks and is being included in some astronomy curriculum at universities. We are now a spacefaring civilization, and there is no reason to suggest there are not other spacefaring civilizations in the Universe. We may not be able to travel between the stars yet, but we can travel within our solar system, having sent robotic landers to Mars and having landed men on the Moon. Computers have advanced immensely since the 1950’s and there is no predicting what technological advances this will lead to soon. We might find now that we are going into space that there exists a political system in place among the spacefaring worlds of the stars that we will be asked to join. This subject has been the life work of Neil Freer, who thought we would soon be invited into stellar civilization, and who dealt with the subject of exopolitics.</p>

<p> Here I present my findings that the solar system mirrors atomic systems and has a quantum mechanical solution to the Schrödinger wave equation based on a base unit of 1 second. I further suggest that this solution for our spectral class G2V star the Sun, may indicate that life is a uniform cosmic unfolding throughout the Universe. In order to test whether this works for many G2V stars like our Sun we would need to detect Earth sized planets around other such stars, to see if my Planck constant works for other planetary systems, which I show is connected to my theory for the radius of a proton in terms the Natural constants such as the gravitational constant for gravity and the Planck constant for atoms. Though we measure time with the duration of a second and it came from no idea in Nature but rather how we divided up the day into units since ancient times, it turns out it is a natural duration in this theory and I suggest it is because of  how we divided up the day and year from observing the  apparent motions of the Sun and stars due to the Earth’s motion, that we may have inadvertently had an idea in this that was Natural in terms of the Nature pf atoms and the Earth/Moon/Sun system. Our theory also seems to based on a sixfold symmetry based around the skeletons of life chemistry, the hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>I further develop an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements and suggest an intermediary mass between that of the proton and the stars. This results in a constant k that is characteristic of the universe and is in inverse velocity. With these we show it may be that yellow G2V stars with a planet in the habitable zone may be a property of the Universe. I find that the Earth/Moon/Sun system gives the eigenvalue or basis vector for Natural Systems predicting the life span of the Universe in the standard cosmological model.</p>

<p>At the end of the paper we apply our theory to another star system, one that is the only one we have detected so far with an Earth-sized planet in it habitable zone. Unfortunately this star is not a yellow G2V star like our Sun, but a red dwarf M star. But we get a feeling for how to apply this theory.</p> 

<p>The central theme of this paper is that life may be a Natural property of the Universe.</p>

<p>Here I present my findings that the solar system mirrors atomic systems and has a quantum mechanical solution to the Schrödinger wave equation based on a base unit of 1 second. I further suggest that this solution for our spectral class G2V star the Sun, may indicate that life is a uniform cosmic unfolding throughout the Universe.

However the first Earth-sized planets have been detected in the habitable zones of stars, and interestingly there are 4 planets in a red dwarf spectral class M star in the habitable zone of a star designated TOI 700 with complete data and fairly small margins of error. Two of them are Earth-sized, but the star is not spectral class G2V like our Sun. However, before that we detected an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of a G2V star like our Sun, but it was not Earth-sized, but rather a super-Earth, which is to say it was much more massive than the Earth, estimated 5 times more massive. And this figure for the mass was an estimate, where for our Earth-sized planets around an M star are well determined. The star for the super-Earth is called Kepler-452 and the planet is called Kepler-452b. We will not work with this one in the paper, as the data is not accurate enough for the size and mass of the planet because the system is so far away. Lightly suggested in this study is the progression from cool red M stars to warm yellow G stars to hot blue A stars in association with a progression from one type of life to another.</p>

<p> Part 1: Here I present my findings that the solar system mirrors atomic systems and has a quantum mechanical solution to the Schrödinger wave equation based on a base unit of 1 second. I further suggest that this solution for our spectral class G2V star the Sun, may indicate that life is a uniform cosmic unfolding throughout the Universe. In this age where we are able to now infer planets around other stars, including Earth-like planets in the habitable zones, and can obtain some of the orbital data, that this theory can soon be tested, because major efforts are underway to build better telescopes and equipment for such inferences, and the the James Webb space telescope has already been employed and is being geared up for such jobs.</p>

<p> Part 2: I introduce a constant k that functions both on the cosmological scale and on the atomic scale. To do this I introduce an intermediary mass in the universe that is the geometric mean between the mass of a proton and the limit in mass for a star to collapse into a white dwarf star without collapsing into a black hole, the Chandrasekhar limit. We find to do this we need to introduce an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements.</p>

<p> Part 3: We connect parts 1 and parts 2.</p>

<p> Part 4: We find the solution to the wave equation for Earth for the rest of the planets. Here we notice that this suggests the possibility of a Genesis Matrix.</p>

<p> Appendix 1: This paper uses the Chandrasekhar Limit for a white dwarf star. Here we explain it.</p>

<p> Historically the hydrogen atom was modeled by Bohr with data of it from observation. Later the Schrödinger wave equation was solved for the hydrogen atom to obtain the same results. In our attempt here to model star systems as quantum mechanical systems we can do the same because we have observations of our solar system. The Schrödinger equation models the Bohr atom for a particle in a bounded sphere and here we are looking at planets not in a sphere but in a disc. Work has been done for the Schrödinger evolution of self gravitating discs. In fact it has been shown since the 1960’s that the Schrödinger equation follows from classical mechanics quite simply from the Hamiltonian formulation of Newton’s laws. But solving it is quite another matter for a disc of particles in a gravitational well. Really, for the hydrogen atom we only have one particle around a proton, and though this can be solved and explain Bohr and the periodic table, it can be impossible for atoms with more than one electron around a nucleus of several protons. However, in this paper we have found a Planck constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system that solves it, so we would be wise to take Bohr’s shortcut at this point, considering the overwhelming complexity of billions of particles in a gravitating disc. This can be done because the Bohr model takes an electron around a proton as a circular orbit and that is what the Earth is around the Sun. It has be taken as an analogy, and not the same, because planetary systems are very different than atoms. For instance electrons can jump from one orbit to another and planets don’t. We find the Planck constant developed in Part 1 does solve a wave equation for the Earth/Moon/Sun system. </p>
<p>It is shown here that the Universe and life unfold in sixfold symmetry where the Earth-Moon-Sun system can be treated much the way quanta such as in the electron-proton system of the atom is treated, and that they are connected to one another. This is done by  introducing a Planck-type constant for the Earth-Moon-Sun system and relating it to that of quantum mechanics. The radius of a proton is predicted in agreement with experiment, and a constant k is developed that comes from an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements that we develop that is again sixfold in Nature. We find that the unit of a second is a natural base unit even though its historical development was not intended as such. With k we can predict the age of the Universe as given by the Friedmann model, the rotation period of the Earth (1 Day), and the Earth orbital period (1 year).  The Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars and the Van Der Waals radius for a hydrogen atom are used in this paper, their theories are in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 respectively. If the solar Planck constant is equal to that of quantum mechanics by a factor of the kinetic energy of the Earth, we are left asking if something like this works for our solar system does it work for other star systems. If it does, then we ask is life part of some cosmic process. We can only answer this when more refined data comes in for earth-like exoplanets around other stars, and the ability to detect moons around these exoplanets because the unit of a second involves the kinetic energy of the Earth’s moon as well. Further we are able to show that our equations yield number as form, which is to say we can put things in set theory to show that one is one object, and that object is a proton, one of the fundamental units for building everything.</p>

<p> Exoanthropology is not a subject today but I thought the word best described what I am doing here. Exopolitics is a word and describes the politics we have with extraterrestrial civilizations if they exist, so there are those people who believe they are actively involved with the politics of other worlds. Exobiology is a word as well, which is the biology of not just the Earth but includes speculation on the biology of life throughout the Universe, also known as astrobiology. We can detect planets around other star systems now, but because of their great distances the data is incomplete and the systems cannot be entirely solved, especially for their moons if they exist. This paper uses a theory I developed about reality that treats the Earth/Moon/Sun system the way we treat an atom, quantum mechanically. As such I have introduced a Planck-type constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system and connected it with that of the atom. The result is that I can solve exoplanetary systems without all of the information. This in fact depends on their being a moon for Earth-like planets in the habitable zones for other stars. It is believed that life bearing planets should have moons, because ours makes life on Earth possible. I use anthropology because I draw upon anthropological concepts, and ultimately to solve the system of an Earth-like exoplanet is to find its calendar as developed by an off-world civilization. In this paper I solve the system for the star Kepler-452 which is a spectral class G star like our Sun with a giant Earth-like planet in its habitable zone.</p>

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We don’t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>
