<p><a href="complete_theory.html">Click here to read Discovering The Common Underlying Principles Between Matter, Space, Time, Life, and the Universe (September 19 2023)</a></p>

<p>The constant k in this paper is a sort of intermediate velocity in the Universe, and so is the intermediary mass used to determine it. While there are small masses in the universe like pebble sized rock and debris in the asteroid belt there are larger masses like planets. The intermediary mass is determined by a proton and white dwarf star. It combined with the intermediary velocity 1/k gives an energy that predict the life span of the universe in the standard Friedman model predicted by when the last stars would be made and burn out from the mass of the Universe.</p>

<p>This intermediary mass and energy seems to be associated with the masses and speed in the human realm between atoms and stars, like a mean for mass and velocity in the universe. It predicts the radius and charge of a proton as well as the life span of the universe. But I asked what do we know of that has exactly these masses and velocities.</p> 

<p>The intermediary mass is 68.897 kg is about 152 pounds. I knew a wolf is less than this a jaguar more, but I found it is exactly an adult male mountain lion, a cougar.

But what speed is 1/k=788.4626m/s. It is 1,764 miles per hour. That is the speed of a fast military jet. it is about mach 2 or twice the speed of sound, which is about 767 miles per hour. Our fastest jet (record holder) went mach 6.7. But it was a real milestone to achieve mach 2 which was first achieved by the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter.</p>

<p>The fastest running animal is the Cheetah. So it would be like the record holding jet at mach 6.7. But the Cougar for  which the adult male is nearly exactly the intermediary mass in the Universe, would be like the F-104 Starfighter which goes almost exactly 1/k.</p>

<p>We utilize a curious equation I arrived at that gives one second nearly perfectly in terms of the atom. I find the same holds for the Earth/Moon/Sun orbital system. It is the orbital periods of these bodies upon which the calendar was developed since ancient times, so it is interesting that it comes up with the duration of a second so nicely that we find in terms of the proton and celestial orbits, here. I undertake to solve the calendar, to find the idea behind it that gives the second describing the proton and heavenly bodies like this. Most interestingly I show that the number six is six protons. This is important because the logical positivists lead by Bertrand Russel sought to explain the meaning of numbers as objects which in the end was a formal system and thus contradicted itself. They gave up on their set theory when Gödel published his Incompleteness Theorem, which showed all formal systems are based on at least one unprovable statement, and are thus incomplete. In solving the calendar we find why we have base 10 counting and it is not just because we have 10 fingers to count on.</p>

<p>We establish an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from which we derive a constant k that predicts the radius of a proton, its charge, the duration of the Universe, the Earth year or orbital period, and the Earth day or Earth rotation. It is based on the six-fold, which we also show predicts the skeletons of life chemistry, the hydrocarbons. The constant brings together the microcosmos and macrocosmos under one underlying principle. We from show the second is a Natural unit, and it further predicts the units of the meter.</p>

<p>I added a new version that finishes solving the calendar. In the process it solves why we have a base 10 counting system. Mathematicians always say it is probably because we have 10 fingers to count on, but I find there is much more to it. When factor 1 and factor 2 cancels it says 6 equals 6 protons. The connection between number and form.</p></p>

Mathematicians always say it is probably because we have 10 fingers to count on, but I find there is much more to it. When factor 1 and factor 2 cancels it says 6 equals 6 protons. The connection between number and form.</p>

<p>Interestingly this harkens back to Bertrand Russel and the Logical Positivists. At the time mathematicians realized nothing had any meaning that we didn't even know what 1, or 2, or 3, or 4....meant. So Bertreand Russel set out to make a mathematics that explained it. He said 4 was 4 objects and he invented set theory that a set was a collection of objects, for which he made rules to explain what an object was But in the end it turned out to contradict itself, then Godel came along and proved that all formal systems have at least one unprovable statement, and are thereby incomplete with his Incompleteness Theorem. So Russel gave up. I think this is connected to 6 equals 6 protons in my theory. I am getting interested now in this set theory and Godel's theorem. But the recently added chapter on solving the calendar has got me very intrigued as well, just where the Ancients got it, or if it evolved to something naturally on its own.</p>

<p>Russel may have given up on logical positivism, but his set theory is used today in applications even though it never said what an object is or a number. I think it is interesting that I get 6 is 6 protons, is carbon or hydrogen is 1 is 1 proton because objects are made up of protons. Interesting is the quark which which are inferred from experiment, cannot owning to the principle of color confinement, exist in isolation, they must be found in hadrons.</p>

<p>We have updated it (Sept 15) for solving the calendar. It would seem the Universe exists but is nothing.</p>

<p>One of the things here to point out is that when I have been using the EarthDay in my equation predicting the unit of a second as natural I have been using the solar day (Earth day with respect to the Sun) which is a little longer than the sidereal day (Earth day with respect to the stars). It makes little very difference, but it is actually a little closer to an actual second if you use the sidereal day. However, I often rounded my equations predicting the unit of a second as a natural unit both in terms of the atom and the Moon and Earth. So in such instances it makes no difference whatsoever. In the case of average kinetic energies (Appendix 1) we have</p>

<p>((3.67E28)/(2.659E22))(86400)=1.1925 seconds</p>

<p>Which is for the solar day, but for the sidereal day we have</p>

<p>1.9374 seconds</p>

<p>For kinetic energies using apogees and perigees (Appendix 1) we have</p>

<p>(3.428E28)/(2.739E22)(86400=1.08134 seconds</p>

<p>Which is for the solar day, but for the sidereal day we have</p>

<p>1.078 seconds</p>

<p>A sidereal day is 86,164.1 seconds</p>

<p>The strange thing is that we find the second is like a natural unit for classical and modern physics in terms of these equations I found for both Moon and Earth and the proton even though the second has a historical origin that goes back to Ancient times long before these disciplines existed. Which means we have something interesting to pursue that pertains to both physics and archaeology. In pursuing the answer to this mystery, it would help to consider things in terms of both the solar day, and the sidereal day, especially if any work is to be done from this in developing a method of defining the second in terms of both the proton and the Earth/Moon/Sun orbital system in terms of not just the calendar that is based on that, but in terms of the equation I have using the Earth and Moon kinetic energies with the Earth day, and in its connection to my equation for proton-seconds, which is used to accurately predict the radius of the proton.</p>


<p><a href="contemporaryanthro.html">Click here to read A Contemporary Anthropology 03 (September 07 2023)</a></p>

<p> Cosmology in physics deals with the study of the birth and death of the Universe using the science of gravity and quanta. But in Anthropology it deals with a People’s way since ancient times of explaining their relationship to the world around them and the Heaven’s (stars, moon, sun, and planets). Given today’s data concerning the world and the Universe, I find we can construct a contemporary cosmology in the anthropological sense. Also..</p>

<p>Alpha Centauri is the ideal star system for a first interstellar mission because it is the closest star system to Earth at 4.2 light years. It is a triple system and interestingly two of the stars are like the Sun Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, G and K main sequence stars with masses  1.1 solar masses and 0.9 solar masses respectively. Alpha Centauri C is a small faint red dwarf but with an Earth sized planet in the habitable zone.</p>

<p>With my abstract cosmology (Beardsley 2023, Abstract Cosmology and Symmetry Theory) I predicted with a sixfold basis of reality a great deal including the radius of a proton and the duration of the life of the Universe in the Standard Friedmann Model by constructing an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements and a constant k that bridges the microcosmos with the macrocosmos. Here as an application of the work we suggest that a first mission to Alpha Centauri may be by design, and that perhaps aliens from, or at least associated with, this star system were behind the Egyptian pyramids.</p>

<p>We find we can suggest that the Earth/Moon/Sun system is technology, though we cannot discern what force would be behind such a design.</p>

<p><a href="moontechnology.html">Click here to read Moon As Technology (September 07 2023)</a></p>

<p> Could other life exist and visit us? Yes, we could be other life, and we have gone to the Moon, have sent rovers to other planets, and plan on leaving our Solar System to go to other star systems. We seem to have every intention to go to other worlds and make contact with other life. Why can’t the same be said of other life doing the same with us? Could it have already come here? Yes, there are star systems with planets much older than ours and therefore there are those that could have life more advanced that could have made the leap out of their star system to come to ours. Given the shear number of stars just in our Galaxy there could be billions of life forms that explore other star systems routinely and that have even mapped out most of the civilizations in our galaxy and may have ours in their registry as “spacefaring but not yet interstellar”. Could other life have engineered us? Yes, we are engineering life in the laboratory and hope to make it from scratch. Who is to say we wouldn’t put it on another planet to evolve into something more intelligent. Who is to say we wouldn’t make it in our image?</p>

<p> Was this not the vision of Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke in their movie 2001 a space Odyssey? If you read Clark’s novel on which the film was based, and its sequels he speaks of this intelligence out there that plants the seeds of life on billions of planets, in their celebration and admiration for thought, cultivates them, and gives them evolutionary nudges where needed. He says they stored their thoughts on frozen lattices of light and their knowledge in the fabric of space itself. That they were not quite gods yet, still slaves to the second law of thermal dynamics.</p>

<p>And indeed many people are afraid to entertain such notions, but in a world such as today’s where technology is advancing at unprecedented rates, where the advances in computer science and electrical engineering are advancing biology and spaceflight faster than we can keep up with it, aren’t we becoming the people Kubrick and Clarke spoke of and wouldn’t indeed be more dangerous to not explore such subjects when we are already arriving there?</p>

<p> As such I feel this paper, that is a follow-up on my other A Contemporary Anthropological Cosmology is well warranted. Indeed the Moon may be a technology, whatever its source may be, and indeed it makes sense to explore the archaeological data base for possible evidence that extraterrestrials have been here. Indeed do not the facts in my paper Contacting ET line up a little to well for coincidence. In the physical, historical, and prehistorical data might there not be clues to hidden activity? With this being the age of information, there is so much more available than there has ever been, and as such there is the likely-hood of connections to be made as to what might be going on beneath the surface.</p>

<p>As a further development in my work "A Contemporary Anthropological Cosmology" we find that it is reasonable to suggest that the Earth/Moon/Sun system is a technology that allows for life though we cannot discern what force is behind such a technology.  .</p>

<p><a href="basis.html">Click here to read The Six-fold Basis of Reality: The Proton Revisited (Published June 10 2023)</a></p>

<p>
Here I hypothesize an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from Avogadro’s number, and determine from that a constant k based on the idea that there is a constant for the intermediary scale between protons and stars using the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars. After constructing a six-fold theory for inertia, or mass, based on the idea that a proton is a three dimensional cross-section of four dimensional hypersphere, I successfully predict the radius of a proton. In the course of this we find the second is a Natural unit of time both in terms of the proton, and gravitational constant G and Planck’s constant h, and in terms of the Earth/ Moon orbital mechanics. I show Avogadro’s number is a natural unit as well, both for the proton and atom, the equation of state, or constant k, and for the macroscale of Moon/Earth/Sun. We also see that this is a consequence of six-fold symmetry based on carbon the core element of life, and hydrocarbons, the skeleton’s or biological life chemistry. We find as well we can determine the charge of a proton with our constant k in terms of the six-fold, as well as the function of the solar magnetic field at Earth orbit.</p>
<p>I really think Nature employs 6-fold symmetry because I think it is the most dynamic being the product of the two smallest prime numbers 2 and 3. Those are the smallest factors down to which anything can be reduced, so that is why I think 6-fold is the basis of Nature, that the basis has to be reduced to the smallest factors. As such we have 2x3=6, 3x3=9, 2x9=18 and 3x6=18. The periodic table of elements is periodic over 18 groups, which means when you count to 18 the elements start over making groups where they have similar properties falling into the same groups. These groups are determined by electron configurations, for instance carbon is in group 4 which means since it wants to have noble gas electron configuration, it gains 4 electrons to be the same as the noble gas in group 18 of the same period. 18-14=4 meaning it ionizes as C4- so it has 4 electrons to combine with 4 hydrogen atoms that are each H+ or so we can have two H atoms that can combine with one oxygen atom which is O2- because oxygen is in group 16 meaning 18-16=2, and so forth making life possible.<p>
<p>Here in this version of the paper we revisit the proton and go into an explanation of the Van Der Waal Radius from which our equation for the radius of a proton was derived. We also explain how the Chandrasekhar limit was derived, but don’t derive it and leave that to the textbooks in Astrophysics that all derive it in their chapters on stellar dynamics. The Chandrasekhar limit is used here for the derivation of our intermediate mass, our constant k, which determines our derivation of the unit of a second of time, and the charge of a proton, as well as the radius of a proton. We find in this second look at the proton we can hone our equation for the radius of a proton for more accuracy and what might be a more dynamic expression than the original equation. We then look at the geometry that follows from it.</p>
