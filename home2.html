<p>In this second edition I added an appendix 5 that develops more analytically (rather than abstractly) the development of inertia as proton-seconds that determines the radius of a proton.</p>


<p><a href="symmetries.html">Click here to read Abstract Cosmology And Symmetry Theory  (August 6 2023)</a></p>

<p>I call it Abstract Cosmology because the approach parallels the approach taken in Abstract Algebra, which is the way my brain works, and I see a great deal of power and elegance in this approach. In Abstract Algebra by David S. Summit and Richard M. Foote they write “It is important to realize, with or without the historical context, that the reason the abstract definitions are made is because it is useful to isolate specific characteristics and consider what structure is imposed on an object having these characteristics.”</p>

<p>In section 1.0 I develop a six-fold basis for reality founded on a constant k that bridges the microcosmos to the macrocosmos, and this is found by developing a definition for an intermediate mass midway between protons and stars. It is necessary to develop an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements, and we find with this approach we can predict the radius of a proton, and discover the six-fold basis of reality, which turns out to be rooted in biological life chemistry. In section 2.0 we touch on eight-fold symmetry and note indeed music from around the world has been based on six-fold and eight-fold, and that it is a current endeavor, and has been for some time, to find the underlying principles common to both, so as to take music to the next level. I see the mathematics of reality, Nature, and the Cosmos as music. In section 3.0 we find our theory in abstract terms suggests the lifespan of the Universe in the Standard Friedmann Model. In section 4.0 we talk about the strange but wonderful thing that the duration of a second, which simply came about from how we divided the rotation period of Earth, and its orbital period, along with that of the Moon into a way of measuring time, that the duration of a second is a Natural Metric with regard to our description of the proton, and of the Earth-Moon-Sun orbital mechanics, and that in the end conveniently measures the lifespan of the Universe, and the length of an Earth day and of an Earth Year. Section 5.0 determines the charge of a proton with our constant k, and section 6.0 shows our theory predict the description of quarks by 8 and 9 fold symmetry. Section 7.0, shows the magnetic field of the Sun may be rooted in the six-fold symmetry of reality and may have a function with regards to life on Earth. Laced throughout this work is the continual suggestion of a “Genesis Project” which was a scientific fantasy of a Star Trek movie where the secrets of life-bearing systems are discovered and allow us to convert dead worlds into living worlds.</p>

<p><a href="Genesis_03.html">Click here to read A Genesis Project Based On A Six-fold Theory of Reality (August 5 2023)</a></p>

<p>We suggest the idea of a Genesis Project based on a six-fold theory of reality. Such a project would be to solve the mystery of life-bearing worlds and systems so as to maintain them or, even to transform dead worlds into living systems.</p>
<p>We develop the concept of intermediary mass somewhere between that of a proton and the lower limit for a white dwarf star. From that we develop a constant k that bridges the microcosmos with the macrocosmos. With this constant we predict the radius of a proton then look at how it explains elements as based around 6-fold symmetry in the core life elements carbon and hydrogen as a consequence of a theory for space, matter and time.</p>
<p>We find that though the Ancients developed the second by dividing the the Earth rotation and orbit, and the Moon’s orbit into a convenient calendar, they unintentionally created the duration of second we have today in a way that conveniently describe the atom and the Earth-Moon- Sun System. It conveniently takes the unit of one in terms them making computing easier in our model. As such we suggest the second is a Natural Metric.</p>
<p>Our six-fold theory of reality for a Genesis Project predicts the life span of the Universe, the length of the Earth day, the length of the Earth year, and explains the ratio of the Moon’s kinetic energy to that of the Earth in terms of the ratio of the radius of a proton to its mass. At the end we suggest the magnetic field of the Sun may predict carbon, the core element of life suggesting, it might play a role in a Genesis Project.</p>

An approach for a so-called Genesis Project is suggested in the last section, Section 4.0. We develop the concept of intermediary mass somewhere between that of a proton and the lower limit for a white dwarf star. From that we develop a constant k that bridges the microcosmos with the macrocosmos.

<p><a href="apophis.html">Click here to read The Moon: Key to the Universe, The Second A Natural Metric, And Apophis (July 16 2023)</a></p>

<p> The reason that motivated me to write this paper was explained in the opening section, but not in its more specific details. It was explained that the Moon seems to give us a hint that we are here for a reason, like it perfectly eclipses the Sun, and that may have been a message to our ancient ancestors, as well as to us today. Or in that the Moon holds the Earth’s inclination to the ecliptic, that keeps the climate right to support life. These things were already known, but I discovered something that made me pursue this as a paper, and that was in that both the proton and the Moon define that duration of a second nearly perfectly, which I have found in many ways make it a good unit for measuring Nature accurately. I call it a “Natural Metric”. In light of how we got the second makes this an even deeper mystery; We got it from the way the ancients divided up the rotation of the Earth and the Earth’s orbit to make a calendar that works well. But I pursued this paper for an even deeper reason than mentioned: I was wondering in light of negative forces in the world and positive forces in the world whether or not we were slated for success as a species from the outset, and the Moon in light of what we already knew, and what I found, gave me good reason to pursue the project. It panned out so well that I began to feel there was something more than certainly going on here. Among other things, like a theory for reality, I found what seems to be life cycles of the Earth and Universe.</p>

<p><a href="basis.html">Click here to read The Six-fold Basis of Reality: The Proton Revisited (Published June 10 2023)</a></p>

<p>
Here I hypothesize an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from Avogadro’s number, and determine from that a constant k based on the idea that there is a constant for the intermediary scale between protons and stars using the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars. After constructing a six-fold theory for inertia, or mass, based on the idea that a proton is a three dimensional cross-section of four dimensional hypersphere, I successfully predict the radius of a proton. In the course of this we find the second is a Natural unit of time both in terms of the proton, and gravitational constant G and Planck’s constant h, and in terms of the Earth/ Moon orbital mechanics. I show Avogadro’s number is a natural unit as well, both for the proton and atom, the equation of state, or constant k, and for the macroscale of Moon/Earth/Sun. We also see that this is a consequence of six-fold symmetry based on carbon the core element of life, and hydrocarbons, the skeleton’s or biological life chemistry. We find as well we can determine the charge of a proton with our constant k in terms of the six-fold, as well as the function of the solar magnetic field at Earth orbit.</p>
<p>I really think Nature employs 6-fold symmetry because I think it is the most dynamic being the product of the two smallest prime numbers 2 and 3. Those are the smallest factors down to which anything can be reduced, so that is why I think 6-fold is the basis of Nature, that the basis has to be reduced to the smallest factors. As such we have 2x3=6, 3x3=9, 2x9=18 and 3x6=18. The periodic table of elements is periodic over 18 groups, which means when you count to 18 the elements start over making groups where they have similar properties falling into the same groups. These groups are determined by electron configurations, for instance carbon is in group 4 which means since it wants to have noble gas electron configuration, it gains 4 electrons to be the same as the noble gas in group 18 of the same period. 18-14=4 meaning it ionizes as C4- so it has 4 electrons to combine with 4 hydrogen atoms that are each H+ or so we can have two H atoms that can combine with one oxygen atom which is O2- because oxygen is in group 16 meaning 18-16=2, and so forth making life possible.<p>
<p>Here in this version of the paper we revisit the proton and go into an explanation of the Van Der Waal Radius from which our equation for the radius of a proton was derived. We also explain how the Chandrasekhar limit was derived, but don’t derive it and leave that to the textbooks in Astrophysics that all derive it in their chapters on stellar dynamics. The Chandrasekhar limit is used here for the derivation of our intermediate mass, our constant k, which determines our derivation of the unit of a second of time, and the charge of a proton, as well as the radius of a proton. We find in this second look at the proton we can hone our equation for the radius of a proton for more accuracy and what might be a more dynamic expression than the original equation. We then look at the geometry that follows from it.</p>

<p><a href="Proposal.html">Click here to read A Proposal For Six-fold Reality (May 26 2023)</a></p>

<p>It is my feeling if you want to reduce reality to its basis it should be in six-fold geometry. Indeed the periodic table seems to be this: the two smallest primes are 2 and 3, and their product is 6. We say 3 squared is 9 and two times 9 is 18 and 18 is 3 times 6. The periodic table is periodic over 18 groups. Here I present my findings of the radius of the proton predicted in terms of this six-fold structure through the skeletons of biological life, the hydrocarbons. To do this I have to show that the second is a natural unit of time, and indeed I do in terms of two different aspects of Universal structure, the planets (in particular the Moon-Earth-Sun system) which is on the macroscale and in terms of the elements, atoms and their Natural constants including both the Planck constant, and the Universal constant of Gravitation. As such this is explaining what Quantum Field Theory strives to explain, gravity of celestial bodies, and electric forces of the atoms in terms of a single theory. To do this I have to introduce a constant k which utilizes Avogadro’s number as a Natural number. I find it can be considered this, that it is not arbitrary, but comes from an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements. I further find electric charges can be explained in terms of six-fold symmetry and that even the Sun’s magnetic field does the same and that this is all perhaps centered around allowing for biological life. I even find the same is true for the rotation of the Earth.<p>

<p>
I believe the reason for my finds of six-fold symmetry in both the radius of a proton and it its charge can be explained by Buckminster Fuller’s vector equilibrium. It is the most transformable straight-line geometry if you attach sticks with flexible corners, what Fuller calls a flex corner. Which means it zero-frequency for omni directional closest packing of spheres is 12 spheres, which is carbon (six protons and six neutrons) which is the basis of life as we know it. Its diameter is then six proton radii which we found provided for by the solar magnetic field. <p>

Here I show that the physical characteristics of the Universe can be described by the six-fold unfolding of space and time in relatively simple terms, namely the characteristics inertia, proton radius, proton charge, and the Sun’s magnetic field. Further that to do this we need to formulate a constant that bridges the macrocosmos to the microcosmos, that is the planets to the proton and the elements. Interestingly, their seems to be correspondence of this with the Old Testament, which is discussed in terms of the cause being perhaps in the Universality of the six- fold. The six-fold theory of reality results in a cosmic calendar, and it is correlated the Earth’s past extinction events. It predict we could be in one now plus or minus 20 million years. However many scientists believe we are in one now (Called the Anthropocene) where human impact on the Earth is changing it drastically, mostly due to burning fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere in excess of 350 parts per million, which causes global warming. We can change that future, however, by switching to cleaner, renewable energy sources. We just have to choose it.
