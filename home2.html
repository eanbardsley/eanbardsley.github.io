This work is the work A Six-fold Theory of Reality with an added section on the six-fold nature of the solar magnetic field and its compatibility with life.

We show that if we base reality on six-fold symmetry we find it is described on every level for all of the building blocks from the microcosmos to the macrocosmos from the atoms to the particles from which they are made (protons) to the skeletal structure of life at it chemical basis the hydrocarbons, to the planets and the moon. This is a rough sketch of the basis of reality as six- fold unfolding where we can predict the radius of a proton and its charge. It all seems to waver around six, sometimes very closely, but we should keep in mind there should be some room for play because for something to have its function based on six it might only has to waver around it. We suggest from what we find about the moon, that the curious fact that it perfectly eclipses the sun as seen from the Earth, that it is there like that to have let us know since the time we were perhaps chipping stones to make spearpoints around the fire at night, that we are not alone in the universe. We formulate the idea of proton-seconds and find it suggests we can make a mathematical formulation of the elements and their compounds aside from our chemical description.

The moon perfectly eclipses the sun as seen from the earth. This is an incredible fact because not only does the moon have to be the right distance from the sun to do this and the right size, the sun also has to be the right size. If this is for a reason, perhaps for the reason to let us know we are here for a reason by forces unknown, then there should be more clues. Perhaps our distant ancestors from which we evolved when sitting around a fire at night flaking stones into spearpoints noticed this and it spoke to them. I find if we consider the universe as the unfolding of six-fold symmetry that we can predict the radius of a proton and its charge as a consequence of the geometry of space as well as predict the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of biological life. While my theory for space and time predicts the radius and charge of a proton, we will mainly consider here the basic equation in its pertinence to the moon, because it suggests a mystery surrounding it. The purpose of this paper is to explore that mystery of the moon. We propose the messenger (that behind the lunar size and orbital radius) based it on the proton because the Sun has to be the size it is, and the earth-moon system the distance it is from the Sun to be in the habitable zone and we show that the earth/moon/sun system is related to the proton mass and size. A proposal for a starting point for developing a logos, or universal language, is given by starting the undertaking with the planetary orbital velocities and it is suggested that the periodic table is outside the basic mathematical operations for a reason as well a non-chemical, but rather mathematical, description of the elements and their compounds is initiated.

<p>It would seem I have carved out a niche for myself regarding origins of humans and speculation of other intelligent life in the Universe. I actually did not try to do this, but I do tend to think about this subject a lot. It would seem my research that is the most successful seems to be in this area. I have three papers I have authored on it that fall into three distinct categories:</p>

1.   <p><a href="primer.html">Searching For The Primer (Jan 31 2023)</a></p>

<p>This one also presents my theory of what the particles that make up matter, like protons, are and how they form atoms that are connected to the planets in structure. The relationship between the microcosmos and the macrocosmos. But it seem to suggest a that these aspects of Nature might speak of as I call it forces that may be (perhaps thinking) may have been behind Nature and left in its mathematics a message.<p>

2.   <p><a href="Contacting_ET_03.html">Click here to read Contacting ET 03 (Jan 13 2023)</a></p>

<p>This one looks more at clues that are in history, geography, and the layout of the land with respect to the stars. It is more archaeological in Nature</p>

3.   <p><a href="Sentient.html">Click here to read Sentient Beings In The Universe: Here And Beyond Earth</a></p>

<p>This one is more theoretical about the kinds of scenarios that may vary from starsysrtem to starsysrtem for different intelligences. We have as I showed in the first paper certain mathematics behind our local universe that may suggest something is behind. Assuming we are not alone in this phenomenon we look at what other intelligences in other star systems may be experiencing as well to suggest there is a mystery as well, just in a different way for different kinds of star systems.</p>

4.    <p>Finally there is the Arcturus paper in the navigation bar of this website on which I am a co-author in The Astrophysical Journal. I worked on this when I was a student at The University of Oregon and working in astronomy at the state observatory in the high desert of Oregon, Pine Mountain Observatory. This paper is a study of the polarized light in the star arcturus, which has applications in detecting planets around other stars. So essentially this is where this kind of work began for me.</p>

The moon perfectly eclipses the sun as seen from the earth. This is an incredible fact because not only does the moon have to be the right distance and size from the sun to do this, the sun also has to be the right size. If this is for a reason, perhaps for the reason to let us know we are here for a reason by forces unknown, then there should be more clues. Perhaps our distant ancestors from which we evolved when sitting around a fire at night flaking stones into spearpoints noticed this and it spoke to them. I find if we consider the universe as the unfolding of six-fold symmetry that we can predict the radius of a proton and its charge as a consequence of the geometry of space as well as predict the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of biological life. We can further show that the planetary orbits are all 6 in a language I formulate that is universal in its structure. The curious thing is we find the duration of one second is natural and common to both atomic systems and planetary systems. The unit of a second was arbitrarily defined historically, but I show that the way we defined it came out giving it structure by mistake because we chose it such that it reconciled the calendar with the earth rotation (day) lunar orbital period (month), earth orbital period (year) and the dividing of the the circle into 360 degrees. It had an effect because the earth day is 365 days is approximately 360, giving it going through one degree a day. The current distances of planets from the sun is what the solar system evolved to and it is the purpose of planetary astronomy to formulate a theory that predicts how from a spinning protoplanetary disc we get these distributions that determine by Kepler’s laws the their orbital periods. We find here that this natural duration of a second describes not just the protons and atoms that make up matter, including the planets themselves, but the structure of the solar system and the hydrocarbons that are the skeletons of biological life that occur here on Earth. Aside from building the Universe here like this, I have found what looks like a message mirroring the earth-moon-system with the atom. I suggest the search for a primer, the keys that unlock what it is saying, what seems to be a message written into our local universe. </p>

<p>
We predict the existence of the proton, its radius and charge as a consequence of space which we show is responsible for inertia, and find everything follows from six-fold symmetry, including the hydrocarbons the skeletons of life. To do this we introduce the idea intermediary mass and shows that one second is a natural unit, not just on the order of the atoms but on the order of the solar system. It follows that the solar system is probably mirroring the atom in that we see it can be described as an equation of state for the Earth-Moon-Sun system that equates to an equation of state for the proton. We introduce the idea of proton-seconds which suggests there might be some use in considering chemical equation as algebraic equations as well. We then present the six-fold nature of the solar system further demonstrating it connection to the atom. </p>

<p>The manifestations of matter from proton mass and radius, and their fields are shown as properties of point, plane, and line that open-up in six-fold symmetry. This is all centered around the life element carbon. We see the planets open up in six-fold symmetry as well. To do our work we introduce a constant k in units of inverse velocity by suggesting the use of an intermediary mass that comes from white dwarf stars. We suggest there is another intermediary mass and k as well based on neutron stars. We suggest that if we want to go further to explain why six-fold symmetry we have to go into the mathematics of symmetry breaking and perturbation theory.</p>

<p>Here we look at cause of causes earlier layer out in 02. A strange story unfolds that seems to be a good lead as to what might be going on surrounding the question of extraterrestrial contact here on earth in modern and ancient times.</p>

<p><a href="SixFold04.html">Click here to read The Basis of the Universe as Six-Fold Symmetry 04 (Updated Jan 08 2023)</a></p>

<p>It would seem at the basis of Nature is six-fold symmetry whether we are talking about biology, like it’s hydrocarbons skeleton, which we do here, or the orbits of the planets. I show the earth is the eigenvalue or characteristic root for the matrix that describes the solar system and to do this I formulate the solar system as six-fold symmetry and suggest this could be taken as a logos, a formulation of the language of Nature. I develop a constant k which is on larger scales compared to Planck’s constant on the quantum scale, and I find it is is necessary to look at the larger scales of chemistry using Avogadro’s number and the velocities of the planets, really to predict the radius of the proton in terms of not just Planck’s constant, but in terms of gravity, G, which takes us into the realm of Quantum Field Theory. Once we establish the idea of proton-seconds we find we can formulate chemical compounds as mathematical, algebraic constructs which is done here. The paper goes from fundamental particles like protons, to atoms, to compounds, and to the planets suggesting perhaps it is all part of the same thing in making up the Universe. Read the paper here, that is a broad sweep of six-fold nature at the basis of the Universe, part of an overall project in process.</p>
