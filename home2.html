<p> Could other life exist and visit us? Yes, we could be other life, and we have gone to the Moon, have sent rovers to other planets, and plan on leaving our Solar System to go to other star systems. We seem to have every intention to go to other worlds and make contact with other life. Why can’t the same be said of other life doing the same with us? Could it have already come here? Yes, there are star systems with planets much older than ours and therefore there are those that could have life more advanced that could have made the leap out of their star system to come to ours. Given the shear number of stars just in our Galaxy there could be billions of life forms that explore other star systems routinely and that have even mapped out most of the civilizations in our galaxy and may have ours in their registry as “spacefaring but not yet interstellar”. Could other life have engineered us? Yes, we are engineering life in the laboratory and hope to make it from scratch. Who is to say we wouldn’t put it on another planet to evolve into something more intelligent. Who is to say we wouldn’t make it in our image?</p>

<p> Was this not the vision of Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke in their movie 2001 a space Odyssey? If you read Clark’s novel on which the film was based, and its sequels he speaks of this intelligence out there that plants the seeds of life on billions of planets, in their celebration and admiration for thought, cultivates them, and gives them evolutionary nudges where needed. He says they stored their thoughts on frozen lattices of light and their knowledge in the fabric of space itself. That they were not quite gods yet, still slaves to the second law of thermal dynamics.</p>

<p>And indeed many people are afraid to entertain such notions, but in a world such as today’s where technology is advancing at unprecedented rates, where the advances in computer science and electrical engineering are advancing biology and spaceflight faster than we can keep up with it, aren’t we becoming the people Kubrick and Clarke spoke of and wouldn’t indeed be more dangerous to not explore such subjects when we are already arriving there?</p>

<p> As such I feel this paper, that is a follow-up on my other A Contemporary Anthropological Cosmology is well warranted. Indeed the Moon may be a technology, whatever its source may be, and indeed it makes sense to explore the archaeological data base for possible evidence that extraterrestrials have been here. Indeed do not the facts in my paper Contacting ET line up a little to well for coincidence. In the physical, historical, and prehistorical data might there not be clues to hidden activity? With this being the age of information, there is so much more available than there has ever been, and as such there is the likely-hood of connections to be made as to what might be going on beneath the surface.</p>

<p>As a further development in my work "A Contemporary Anthropological Cosmology" we find that it is reasonable to suggest that the Earth/Moon/Sun system is a technology that allows for life though we cannot discern what force is behind such a technology.  .</p>

<p><a href="Anthropological_Cosmology.html">Click here to read A Contemporary Anthropological Cosmology (August 31 2023)</a></p>

<p>Cosmology in physics deals with the study of the birth and death of the Universe using the science of gravity and quanta. But in Anthropology it deals with a People’s way since ancient times of explaining their relationship to the world around them and the Heaven’s (stars, moon, sun, and planets). Given today’s data concerning the world and the Universe, I find we can construct a contemporary cosmology in the anthropological sense. Also.. .</p>

<p>In this second edition I added an appendix 5 that develops more analytically (rather than abstractly) the development of inertia as proton-seconds that determines the radius of a proton.</p>

<p>It turns out 1 second is not just Natural but the metric, it describes all the cycles of Universe in its structural bases.</p><p>We see the moon is not just connected to the protons that make elements but to the elementsgold and silver that are the metals for ceremonial jewelries and we see it is connected to whenthe universe would die in the standard cosmological model, as well as it defines the unit of asecond as mysteriously natural. We develop the idea of inertia as proton-seconds which ismatter as a consequence of space and time and from it determine the radius of a proton. Aswell the idea determines the charge of a proton. We see it arises from six-fold symmetrieswhich we suggest makes for a good basis of Nature.</p><p>In this paper we ask why did we find the second to be Natural in terms of physics when it camefrom the way the ancients made our calendar and divided it up. We find it is because their ideawas based on geometric principles that reconcile six-fold symmetry with eightfold symmetry,and we include how this happens in the periodic table of the elements.</p><p>It turns out 1 second is not just Natural but the metric, it describes all the cycles of Universe in its structural bases. We see the life span of the universe is measured nicely by the second, as well as the period of of one rotation of the the Earth, the earth day, and that the moon defines the second as well as the radius of a proton and its mass.</p>

<p><a href="basis.html">Click here to read The Six-fold Basis of Reality: The Proton Revisited (Published June 10 2023)</a></p>

<p>
Here I hypothesize an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from Avogadro’s number, and determine from that a constant k based on the idea that there is a constant for the intermediary scale between protons and stars using the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars. After constructing a six-fold theory for inertia, or mass, based on the idea that a proton is a three dimensional cross-section of four dimensional hypersphere, I successfully predict the radius of a proton. In the course of this we find the second is a Natural unit of time both in terms of the proton, and gravitational constant G and Planck’s constant h, and in terms of the Earth/ Moon orbital mechanics. I show Avogadro’s number is a natural unit as well, both for the proton and atom, the equation of state, or constant k, and for the macroscale of Moon/Earth/Sun. We also see that this is a consequence of six-fold symmetry based on carbon the core element of life, and hydrocarbons, the skeleton’s or biological life chemistry. We find as well we can determine the charge of a proton with our constant k in terms of the six-fold, as well as the function of the solar magnetic field at Earth orbit.</p>
<p>I really think Nature employs 6-fold symmetry because I think it is the most dynamic being the product of the two smallest prime numbers 2 and 3. Those are the smallest factors down to which anything can be reduced, so that is why I think 6-fold is the basis of Nature, that the basis has to be reduced to the smallest factors. As such we have 2x3=6, 3x3=9, 2x9=18 and 3x6=18. The periodic table of elements is periodic over 18 groups, which means when you count to 18 the elements start over making groups where they have similar properties falling into the same groups. These groups are determined by electron configurations, for instance carbon is in group 4 which means since it wants to have noble gas electron configuration, it gains 4 electrons to be the same as the noble gas in group 18 of the same period. 18-14=4 meaning it ionizes as C4- so it has 4 electrons to combine with 4 hydrogen atoms that are each H+ or so we can have two H atoms that can combine with one oxygen atom which is O2- because oxygen is in group 16 meaning 18-16=2, and so forth making life possible.<p>
<p>Here in this version of the paper we revisit the proton and go into an explanation of the Van Der Waal Radius from which our equation for the radius of a proton was derived. We also explain how the Chandrasekhar limit was derived, but don’t derive it and leave that to the textbooks in Astrophysics that all derive it in their chapters on stellar dynamics. The Chandrasekhar limit is used here for the derivation of our intermediate mass, our constant k, which determines our derivation of the unit of a second of time, and the charge of a proton, as well as the radius of a proton. We find in this second look at the proton we can hone our equation for the radius of a proton for more accuracy and what might be a more dynamic expression than the original equation. We then look at the geometry that follows from it.</p>
