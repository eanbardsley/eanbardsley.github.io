<p> This is the continuance of my paper A Precise Theory for the Proton Radius and the Elements as Mathematical Sets. Since we developed a theory for inertia that predicted the proton radius, and in doing this developed a Planck constant for the macrocosmos of the solar system connected to the microcosmos of atoms, and developed an equation of state for the periodic table and showed this includes the hydrocarbons, the backbones of life chemistry, we needed to now predict the amino acids, the building blocks of life. Then we predict ribose the fundamental sugar of life that is a primary component to DNA and RNA that provide the instructions for life. In writing this chapter in the project we found we had summarized the key talking points of the theory, that can be read separately. One would have to resort to the original complete paper to find the verifications of the equations. But essentially what we have here now is a clear picture of the role of the Universe in the emergence of life. Now that we have the amino acids and ribose, we need the purines, or nucleobases adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil, and the phosphate backbone DNA and RNA. The findings here may shed light on origins of life on Earth, the prebiotic path.</p>

<p>In this the fourth edition in section 12.0 we suggest if the nature of space and time is such the
radius of a proton is given by the golden ratio, then we can determine its value exactly in theory
and we find this in turn gives the momentum-distance of quantum mechanics, and the
asymptote of the special relativity hyperbola of spacetime diagrams that is the world-line of a
light signal.

<p> One of things I wanted to go into in this paper but didn’t is that you can speak of the structure of the solar system even though it changes with time. This is important to understand when I refer to sizes the Moon and the planets, and their orbital distances.</p>

<p>The proton is the fundamental charged particle that makes up atoms. We develop a theory of inertia with the proton as a 3d cross-section of a 4d hypersphere and suggest in terms of set theory that since no proton is unique that number of protons is actually number.  This describes the elements of the periodic table as sets of protons in a mathematical sense, and we suggest this is geared around six-fold symmetry in a way that optimizes the conditions for biological life. The radius of a proton is the least precise data value among the constants but new methods of measuring it are honing in on its actual value. If our set theory for the elements in terms of protons optimizes for life, then we have from our theory a value that is more within the current finest measurements. We also suggest the unit of a second is a natural unit as luck would have it, and that it occurs in the orbital elements of the Earth/Moon/Sun system. We determine a constant k and intermediate mass that bridges the macrocosmos to the microcosmos that predicts many things both on the atomic and astronomical and cosmological scales. It appears our moon orbiting the earth may have connections on the atomic and cosmological scales. We present the Solar System as quantum mechanical. In this second edition we come up with another equation for the radius of a proton independent of Avogadro’s number which gives us more equations for the unit of a second as natural to relate to the orbit of our Moon.</p>

<p>We utilize a curious equation I arrived at that gives one second nearly perfectly in terms of the atom. I find the same holds for the Earth/Moon/Sun orbital system. It is the orbital periods of these bodies upon which the calendar was developed since ancient times, so it is interesting that it comes up with the duration of a second so nicely that we find in terms of the proton and celestial orbits, here. I undertake to solve the calendar, to find the idea behind it that gives the second describing the proton and heavenly bodies like this. Most interestingly I show that the number six is six protons. This is important because the logical positivists whose set theory invented by Georg Cantor sought to explain the meaning of numbers as objects which in the end was a formal system and thus contradicted itself. They gave up on their set theory when Gödel published his Incompleteness Theorem, which showed all formal systems are based on at least one unprovable statement, and are thus incomplete. In solving the calendar we find why we have base 10 counting and it is not just because we have 10 fingers to count on.</p>

<p>We establish an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from which we derive a constant k that predicts the radius of a proton, its charge, the duration of the Universe, the Earth year or orbital period, and the Earth day or Earth rotation. It is based on the six-fold, which we also show predicts the skeletons of life chemistry, the hydrocarbons. The constant brings together the microcosmos and macrocosmos under one underlying principle. We show the second is a Natural unit, and it further predicts the units of the meter.</p>

<p>In the end of the paper we present the solar system as a quantum mechanical system and this results in the so-called Genesis Project equations. </p>
