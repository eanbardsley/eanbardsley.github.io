I describe inertia as a proton that is a 4D hypersphere whose cross section is a 3D sphere acted on by space. We see it is based on six-fold symmetry, as I show with the charge of a proton modeled as a field that arises from crossing one component of time into another that describes time as an expanding sphere whose expansion separates events (successive shells) at the speed of light. A constant (k) is presented that is like an intermediary Planck’s constant bridging the microcosmos to the macrocosmos, the protons to the planets, it is a necessary constant in all of the modeling for inertia and charge. I show the solar magnetic field is born from the same six- fold symmetry as everything else. An equation that defines the solar magnetic field is presented in terms of the Sun’s gravity, the ionization energy of hydrogen, and the radius of a hydrogen atom. This paper suggests that the sixfold symmetry of inertia, charge, and solar magnetic field puts the basis of life (carbon) at the crux of reality. This is expressed in terms of the hydrocarbon skeletons of biological chemistry. We see in this paper that the second should be considered a natural unit as it is given as six seconds is hydrogen and 1 second is carbon, are upper and lower limits for integer values for our equations of inertia. As well we suggest the mole should be considered a natural unit.

Here I show that the physical characteristics of the Universe can be described by the six-fold unfolding of space and time in relatively simple terms, namely the characteristics inertia, proton radius, proton charge, and the Sun’s magnetic field. Further that to do this we need to formulate a constant that bridges the macrocosmos to the microcosmos, that is the planets to the proton and the elements. Interestingly, their seems to be correspondence of this with the Old Testament, which is discussed in terms of the cause being perhaps in the Universality of the six- fold. The six-fold theory of reality results in a cosmic calendar, and it is correlated the Earth’s past extinction events. It predict we could be in one now plus or minus 20 million years. However many scientists believe we are in one now (Called the Anthropocene) where human impact on the Earth is changing it drastically, mostly due to burning fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere in excess of 350 parts per million, which causes global warming. We can change that future, however, by switching to cleaner, renewable energy sources. We just have to choose it.
