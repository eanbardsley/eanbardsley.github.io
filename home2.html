<p>It would seem the second is not just natural but the metric for the cycles of the Universe at its structural bases</p>

<p>Here I question the idea I saw in a documentary that the edge of the observable universe is the event horizon of a blackhole.</p>

<p> We see the moon is not just connected to the protons that make elements but to the elements gold and silver that are the metals for ceremonial jewelries and we see it is connected to when the universe would die in the standard cosmological model, as well as it defines the unit of a second as mysteriously natural. We develop the idea of inertia as proton-seconds which is matter as a consequence of space and time and from it determine the radius of a proton. As well the idea determines the charge of a proton. We see it arises from six-fold symmetries which we suggest makes for a good basis of Nature.</p>

<p>In this paper we ask why did we find the second to be Natural in terms of physics when it came from the way the ancients made our calendar and divided it up. We find it is because their idea was based on geometric principles that reconcile six-fold symmetry with eightfold symmetry, and we include how this happens in the periodic table of the elements. </p>

<p>I decided to look at my theory of inertia and proton-seconds through the lens of what these people were doing at that time in terms of illustrations. My theory in my paper The Moon: Key to the Universe.</p>

<p>Referring to the equation for the lifespan of the universe (top of page 20, section 4.0) or the equations for the lifespan of the universe section 9.0 page 43 at the of the page, we add the following about the fate of the Universe:

<p>If the universe was born from a big explosion called ‚Äúthe big bang‚Äù then it is expanding and the distances between galaxies is growing. This does not mean there is an edge to the universe ‚Äîspace could continue on infinitely in all directions but there could be a horizon beyond which there is no content.</p>

<p>There can be an observable edge to the universe, but it is more of a horizon, just as there is a horizon to the ocean, we know beyond the horizon there is more water. Since the universe was born 13.82 billion years ago in the Big Bang we can only see those galaxies whose light has taken less than 13.82 billion years to reach us. These galaxies form a sphere around the Earth called ‚Äúthe observable universe‚Äù. It is 92 billion light years in diameter because in its beginning the universe inflated much faster than the speed of light.</p>

<p>The Schwartzchild radius:</p>


<p>rùöú=2GM/c¬≤</p>

<p>Gives the event horizon of a black hole. As it would turn out if the mass, M, is the mass of the universe, that radius is the edge of the observable universe, so some cosmologists are suggesting the observable edge of the universe is actually the event horizon of a black hole and that then the Universe is a giant black hole and that we are inside of it.</p>

<p>The pivotal parameter describing the universe is ùõÄ (omega) which is the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. Whether omega is less than1, 1, or greater than 1 determines whether the Universe is open, flat, or closed. If matter is mostly inert as in the dust models, there is a particular fate for each omega. Since 1998 the observations in supernovas indicate the universe is accelerating in its expansion. To explain this cosmologists hypothesize the existence of dark energy which can be any field with negative entropy causing negative pressure. If ùõÄ<1 then the Universe is open and the fate of the universe is in its heat death, the burning out of the last stars born. This is also true of a flat universe if it has the hypothesized dark energy, because then it accelerates to escape collapse. The fate of the universe depends on its density and today most evidence points to it will expand indefinitely. In this scenario there is enough a supply of gas  for stars to form for 10¬π¬≤ to 10¬π‚Å¥ years. 1 to 100 trillion years. That is the last stars born would die in 10¬π‚Å¥ years.</p>

<p>There are models that suggest the universe is eternal where as stars die more matter comes into existence from which more stars are continuously forming.</p>

<p>We describe reality as being based in the six-fold. I really think Nature employs 6-fold symmetry because I think it is the most dynamic being the product of the two smallest prime numbers 2 and 3. Those are the smallest factors down to which anything can be reduced, so that is why I think 6-fold is the basis of Nature, that the basis has to be reduced to the smallest factors. As such we have 2x3=6, 3x3=9, 2x9=18 and 3x6=18. The periodic table of elements is periodic over 18 groups, which means when you count to 18 the elements start over making groups where they have similar properties falling into the same groups. These groups are determined by electron configurations, for instance carbon is in group 4 which means since it wants to have noble gas electron configuration, it gains 4 electrons to be the same as the noble gas in group 18 of the same period. 18-14=4 meaning it ionizes as C4- so it has 4 electrons to combine with 4 hydrogen atoms that are each H+ or so we can have two H atoms that can combine with one oxygen atom which is O2- because oxygen is in group 16 meaning 18-16=2, and so forth making life possible.<p>
<p>From here we can determine a theoretical value for the radius of the proton that falls within experimental errors. We propose defining inertia as proton-seconds, the action of subatomic particles like the proton over time. We see this is based around biological life, hydrogen and carbon which makes the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of organic matter. We develop a constant k that bridges the microcosmos, like the elements and their constituents, with the macrocosmos, like the earth-moon system. We find that though the unit of a second was developed by the way we constructed our calendar, it actually is a Natural Unit in the SI system of units, as incredible as that may seem. It describes both the moon‚Äôs orbit and the proton for which we find their is a mystery which this paper mainly addresses. We find the magnetic field generated by the Sun displays the same six-fold symmetry we are finding at the basis of reality and that is defined by biological life. We propose the solar magnetic field may play a role in the outcome of life; we know the DNA molecule spirals preferentially in one direction over another and scientists have hypothesized it may be from a net circular polarization in one direction of light from the Sun that is caused by magnetic fields in sunspot activity. Though as well this may come from cosmic ray net circular polarizations that have been guiding the evolution of life on Earth.</p>
<p>
To develop our constant k, we have to formulate an intermediary mass characteristic of Universe between the proton and the stars in scale. This is done by using the Chandrasekhar limit for the mass of of a star to not collapse into a blackhole, but to be able to counter its gravitational force with pressure from electron degeneracy alone.We find we can also determine the proton charge with our constant k that determines the proton-radius.‚Ä©</p>

<p><a href="basis.html">Click here to read The Six-fold Basis of Reality: The Proton Revisited (Published June 10 2023)</a></p>

<p>
Here I hypothesize an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from Avogadro‚Äôs number, and determine from that a constant k based on the idea that there is a constant for the intermediary scale between protons and stars using the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars. After constructing a six-fold theory for inertia, or mass, based on the idea that a proton is a three dimensional cross-section of four dimensional hypersphere, I successfully predict the radius of a proton. In the course of this we find the second is a Natural unit of time both in terms of the proton, and gravitational constant G and Planck‚Äôs constant h, and in terms of the Earth/ Moon orbital mechanics. I show Avogadro‚Äôs number is a natural unit as well, both for the proton and atom, the equation of state, or constant k, and for the macroscale of Moon/Earth/Sun. We also see that this is a consequence of six-fold symmetry based on carbon the core element of life, and hydrocarbons, the skeleton‚Äôs or biological life chemistry. We find as well we can determine the charge of a proton with our constant k in terms of the six-fold, as well as the function of the solar magnetic field at Earth orbit.</p>

<p>Here in this version of the paper we revisit the proton and go into an explanation of the Van Der Waal Radius from which our equation for the radius of a proton was derived. We also explain how the Chandrasekhar limit was derived, but don‚Äôt derive it and leave that to the textbooks in Astrophysics that all derive it in their chapters on stellar dynamics. The Chandrasekhar limit is used here for the derivation of our intermediate mass, our constant k, which determines our derivation of the unit of a second of time, and the charge of a proton, as well as the radius of a proton. We find in this second look at the proton we can hone our equation for the radius of a proton for more accuracy and what might be a more dynamic expression than the original equation. We then look at the geometry that follows from it.</p>

<p>It is my feeling if you want to reduce reality to its basis it should be in six-fold geometry. Indeed the periodic table seems to be this: the two smallest primes are 2 and 3, and their product is 6. We say 3 squared is 9 and two times 9 is 18 and 18 is 3 times 6. The periodic table is periodic over 18 groups. Here I present my findings of the radius of the proton predicted in terms of this six-fold structure through the skeletons of biological life, the hydrocarbons. To do this I have to show that the second is a natural unit of time, and indeed I do in terms of two different aspects of Universal structure, the planets (in particular the Moon-Earth-Sun system) which is on the macroscale and in terms of the elements, atoms and their Natural constants including both the Planck constant, and the Universal constant of Gravitation. As such this is explaining what Quantum Field Theory strives to explain, gravity of celestial bodies, and electric forces of the atoms in terms of a single theory. To do this I have to introduce a constant k which utilizes Avogadro‚Äôs number as a Natural number. I find it can be considered this, that it is not arbitrary, but comes from an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements. I further find electric charges can be explained in terms of six-fold symmetry and that even the Sun‚Äôs magnetic field does the same and that this is all perhaps centered around allowing for biological life. I even find the same is true for the rotation of the Earth.<p>

I believe the reason for my finds of six-fold symmetry in both the radius of a proton and it its charge can be explained by Buckminster Fuller‚Äôs vector equilibrium. It is the most transformable straight-line geometry if you attach sticks with flexible corners, what Fuller calls a flex corner. Which means it zero-frequency for omni directional closest packing of spheres is 12 spheres, which is carbon (six protons and six neutrons) which is the basis of life as we know it. Its diameter is then six proton radii which we found provided for by the solar magnetic field. <p>

Here I show that the physical characteristics of the Universe can be described by the six-fold unfolding of space and time in relatively simple terms, namely the characteristics inertia, proton radius, proton charge, and the Sun‚Äôs magnetic field. Further that to do this we need to formulate a constant that bridges the macrocosmos to the microcosmos, that is the planets to the proton and the elements. Interestingly, their seems to be correspondence of this with the Old Testament, which is discussed in terms of the cause being perhaps in the Universality of the six- fold. The six-fold theory of reality results in a cosmic calendar, and it is correlated the Earth‚Äôs past extinction events. It predict we could be in one now plus or minus 20 million years. However many scientists believe we are in one now (Called the Anthropocene) where human impact on the Earth is changing it drastically, mostly due to burning fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere in excess of 350 parts per million, which causes global warming. We can change that future, however, by switching to cleaner, renewable energy sources. We just have to choose it.
