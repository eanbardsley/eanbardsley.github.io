<p>
I believe the reason for my finds of six-fold symmetry in both the radius of a proton and it its charge can be explained by Buckminster Fuller’s vector equilibrium. It is the most transformable straight-line geometry if you attach sticks with flexible corners, what Fuller calls a flex corner. Which means it zero-frequency for omni directional closest packing of spheres is 12 spheres, which is carbon (six protons and six neutrons) which is the basis of life as we know it. Its diameter is then six proton radii which we found provided for by the solar magnetic field. <p>

Here I show that the physical characteristics of the Universe can be described by the six-fold unfolding of space and time in relatively simple terms, namely the characteristics inertia, proton radius, proton charge, and the Sun’s magnetic field. Further that to do this we need to formulate a constant that bridges the macrocosmos to the microcosmos, that is the planets to the proton and the elements. Interestingly, their seems to be correspondence of this with the Old Testament, which is discussed in terms of the cause being perhaps in the Universality of the six- fold. The six-fold theory of reality results in a cosmic calendar, and it is correlated the Earth’s past extinction events. It predict we could be in one now plus or minus 20 million years. However many scientists believe we are in one now (Called the Anthropocene) where human impact on the Earth is changing it drastically, mostly due to burning fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere in excess of 350 parts per million, which causes global warming. We can change that future, however, by switching to cleaner, renewable energy sources. We just have to choose it.
