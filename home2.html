<p>We utilize a curious equation I arrived at that gives one second nearly perfectly in terms of the atom. I find the same holds for the Earth/Moon/Sun orbital system. It is the orbital periods of these bodies upon which the calendar was developed since ancient times, so it is interesting that it comes up with the duration of a second so nicely that we find in terms of the proton and celestial orbits, here. I undertake to solve the calendar, to find the idea behind it that gives the second describing the proton and heavenly bodies like this. Most interestingly I show that the number six is six protons. This is important because the logical positivists whose set theory invented by Georg Cantor sought to explain the meaning of numbers as objects which in the end was a formal system and thus contradicted itself. They gave up on their set theory when Gödel published his Incompleteness Theorem, which showed all formal systems are based on at least one unprovable statement, and are thus incomplete. In solving the calendar we find why we have base 10 counting and it is not just because we have 10 fingers to count on.</p>

<p>We establish an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from which we derive a constant k that predicts the radius of a proton, its charge, the duration of the Universe, the Earth year or orbital period, and the Earth day or Earth rotation. It is based on the six-fold, which we also show predicts the skeletons of life chemistry, the hydrocarbons. The constant brings together the microcosmos and macrocosmos under one underlying principle. We show the second is a Natural unit, and it further predicts the units of the meter.</p>

<p>In the end of the paper we present the solar system as a quantum mechanical system and this results in the so-called Genesis Project equations. </p>
