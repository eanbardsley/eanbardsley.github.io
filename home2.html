<p>Here I present my findings that the solar system mirrors atomic systems and has a quantum mechanical solution to the Schrödinger wave equation based on a base unit of 1 second. I further suggest that this solution for our spectral class G2V star the Sun, may indicate that life is a uniform cosmic unfolding throughout the Universe. In order to test whether this works for many G2V star like our Sun we would need to detect Earth sized planets around such other such stars, to see if my Planck constant works for other planetary systems, which I show is connected to the my theory for the radius of a proton in terms the Natural constants such as the gravitational constant for gravity and the Planck constant for atoms. However the first Earth-sized planets have been detected in the habitable zones of stars, and interestingly there are 4 planets in a red dwarf spectral class M star in the habitable zone of a star designated TOI 700 with complete data and fairly small margins of error. Two of them are Earth-sized, but the star is not spectral class G2V like our Sun. However, before that we detected an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of a G2V star like our Sun, but it was not Earth-sized, but rather a super-Earth, which is to say it was much more massive than the Earth, estimated 5 times more massive. And this figure for the mass was an estimate, where for our Earth-sized planets around an M star are well determined. The star for the super-Earth is called Kepler-452 and the planet is called Kepler-452b. We will not work with this one in the paper, as the data is not accurate enough for the size and mass of the planet because the system is so far away. Lightly suggested in this study is the progression from cool red M stars to warm yellow G stars to hot blue A stars in association with a progression from one type of life to another.</p>

I further suggest that this solution for our spectral class G2V star the Sun, may indicate that life is a uniform cosmic unfolding throughout the Universe.

<p> Part 2: I introduce a constant k that functions both on the cosmological scale and on the atomic scale. To do this I introduce an intermediary mass in the universe that is the geometric mean between the mass of a proton and the limit in mass for a star to collapse into a white dwarf star without collapsing into a black hole, the Chandrasekhar limit. We find to do this we need to introduce an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements.</p>

<p> Part 3: We connect parts 1 and parts 2.</p>

<p> Part 4: We find the solution to the wave equation for Earth for the rest of the planets. Here we notice that this suggests the possibility of a Genesis Matrix.</p>

<p> Appendix 1: This paper uses the Chandrasekhar Limit for a white dwarf star. Here we explain it.</p>

<p> Historically the hydrogen atom was modeled by Bohr with data of it from observation. Later the Schrödinger wave equation was solved for the hydrogen atom to obtain the same results. In our attempt here to model star systems as quantum mechanical systems we can do the same because we have observations of our solar system. The Schrödinger equation models the Bohr atom for a particle in a bounded sphere and here we are looking at planets not in a sphere but in a disc. Work has been done for the Schrödinger evolution of self gravitating discs. In fact it has been shown since the 1960’s that the Schrödinger equation follows from classical mechanics quite simply from the Hamiltonian formulation of Newton’s laws. But solving it is quite another matter for a disc of particles in a gravitational well. Really, for the hydrogen atom we only have one particle around a proton, and though this can be solved and explain Bohr and the periodic table, it can be impossible for atoms with more than one electron around a nucleus of several protons. However, in this paper we have found a Planck constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system that solves it, so we would be wise to take Bohr’s shortcut at this point, considering the overwhelming complexity of billions of particles in a gravitating disc. This can be done because the Bohr model takes an electron around a proton as a circular orbit and that is what the Earth is around the Sun. It has be taken as an analogy, and not the same, because planetary systems are very different than atoms. For instance electrons can jump from one orbit to another and planets don’t. We find the Planck constant developed in Part 1 does solve a wave equation for the Earth/Moon/Sun system. </p>
<p>It is shown here that the Universe and life unfold in sixfold symmetry where the Earth-Moon-Sun system can be treated much the way quanta such as in the electron-proton system of the atom is treated, and that they are connected to one another. This is done by  introducing a Planck-type constant for the Earth-Moon-Sun system and relating it to that of quantum mechanics. The radius of a proton is predicted in agreement with experiment, and a constant k is developed that comes from an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements that we develop that is again sixfold in Nature. We find that the unit of a second is a natural base unit even though its historical development was not intended as such. With k we can predict the age of the Universe as given by the Friedmann model, the rotation period of the Earth (1 Day), and the Earth orbital period (1 year).  The Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars and the Van Der Waals radius for a hydrogen atom are used in this paper, their theories are in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 respectively. If the solar Planck constant is equal to that of quantum mechanics by a factor of the kinetic energy of the Earth, we are left asking if something like this works for our solar system does it work for other star systems. If it does, then we ask is life part of some cosmic process. We can only answer this when more refined data comes in for earth-like exoplanets around other stars, and the ability to detect moons around these exoplanets because the unit of a second involves the kinetic energy of the Earth’s moon as well. Further we are able to show that our equations yield number as form, which is to say we can put things in set theory to show that one is one object, and that object is a proton, one of the fundamental units for building everything.</p>

<p><a href="exoanthropology.html">Click here to read A Proposal In Exoanthropology (Updated December 04 2023)</a></p>

<p> Exoanthropology is not a subject today but I thought the word best described what I am doing here. Exopolitics is a word and describes the politics we have with extraterrestrial civilizations if they exist, so there are those people who believe they are actively involved with the politics of other worlds. Exobiology is a word as well, which is the biology of not just the Earth but includes speculation on the biology of life throughout the Universe, also known as astrobiology. We can detect planets around other star systems now, but because of their great distances the data is incomplete and the systems cannot be entirely solved, especially for their moons if they exist. This paper uses a theory I developed about reality that treats the Earth/Moon/Sun system the way we treat an atom, quantum mechanically. As such I have introduced a Planck-type constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system and connected it with that of the atom. The result is that I can solve exoplanetary systems without all of the information. This in fact depends on their being a moon for Earth-like planets in the habitable zones for other stars. It is believed that life bearing planets should have moons, because ours makes life on Earth possible. I use anthropology because I draw upon anthropological concepts, and ultimately to solve the system of an Earth-like exoplanet is to find its calendar as developed by an off-world civilization. In this paper I solve the system for the star Kepler-452 which is a spectral class G star like our Sun with a giant Earth-like planet in its habitable zone.</p>

<p><a href="exoplanets.html">Click here to read Life As Part Of A Cosmic Process (Nov 29 2023)</a></p>

<p> This paper strives to address a question suggested by my theory that is whether life is part of a cosmic process. We have a theory for the Earth/Moon/Sun system as analogous to a quantum mechanical system for the atom. It uses a Planck constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system and it is related to the Planck constant, h, of quantum mechanics. It seems to produce Earth orbit as fundamental in its connection to the atom. We have to ask then if, since the Earth is connected to the atom as a physical system, does the theory apply to other star systems. If it does it would suggest life is part of a cosmic process, and we have to ask if it is, what is behind it. To answer whether life is part of a cosmic process, then, we have to see if what was found applies to other star systems with life-bearing worlds. While the data is scant and ballpark, we have some and are able to apply the formula to Kepler-452b which has a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of its star. The only problem is we currently can detect some planets around stars, but we can not yet resolve something like a moon orbiting an exoplanet because such a thing is far to small to resolve. We can, however, make an educated guess as to what its mass might be given the size of the planet it orbits. The formula involves the moon of a life-bearing world, and for a world to bear life it is believed it needs a moon to hold its inclination to its orbital plane, relatively steady. It may be our formula only holds for main sequence spectral-type G stars, like our Sun (or spectral types close to it). The majority of exoplanets so far detectable with current technology are spectral class M, red dwarf stars, more than likely because such stars are the most populous in our galaxy. The theory is in my paper The Sixfold Unfolding of the Universe and Life, Ian Beardsley, 2023.</p>

<p>If h_solar is connected to h_planck then Earth orbit is connected to the atom (KE_earth). If this is true of our solar system, is it true of other star systems for their life bearing worlds? It leaves one asking if life is part of some cosmic process is something behind it?<p>

<p>It took me several years; the truth is well hidden, but when revealed is sublime.<p>

<p> It is shown here that the Universe and life unfold in sixfold symmetry where the Earth-Moon-Sun system can be treated much the way quanta such as in the electron-proton system of the atom is treated, and that they are connected to one another.

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We don’t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>

<p> This is the continuance of my paper A Precise Theory for the Proton Radius and the Elements as Mathematical Sets. Since we developed a theory for inertia that predicted the proton radius, and in doing this developed a Planck constant for the macrocosmos of the solar system connected to the microcosmos of atoms, and developed an equation of state for the periodic table and showed this includes the hydrocarbons, the backbones of life chemistry, we needed to now predict the amino acids, the building blocks of life. Then we predict ribose the fundamental sugar of life that is a primary component to DNA and RNA that provide the instructions for life. In writing this chapter in the project we found we had summarized the key talking points of the theory, that can be read separately. One would have to resort to the original complete paper to find the verifications of the equations. But essentially what we have here now is a clear picture of the role of the Universe in the emergence of life. Now that we have the amino acids and ribose, we need the purines, or nucleobases adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil, and the phosphate backbone DNA and RNA. The findings here may shed light on origins of life on Earth, the prebiotic path.</p>

<p><a href="proton_set_theory_08.html">Click here to read A Precise Theory for the Proton Radius and the Elements as Mathematical Sets Seventh Edition (Nov 14 2023)</a></p>

<p>In this the seventh edition we include now the hydrocarbons, amino acids, ribose, DNA and RNA</p>

<p>The proton is the fundamental charged particle that makes up atoms. We develop a theory of inertia with the proton as a 3d cross-section of a 4d hypersphere and suggest in terms of set theory that since no proton is unique that number of protons is actually number.  This describes the elements of the periodic table as sets of protons in a mathematical sense, and we suggest this is geared around six-fold symmetry in a way that optimizes the conditions for biological life. The radius of a proton is the least precise data value among the constants but new methods of measuring it are honing in on its actual value. If our set theory for the elements in terms of protons optimizes for life, then we have from our theory a value that is more within the current finest measurements. We also suggest the unit of a second is a natural unit as luck would have it, and that it occurs in the orbital elements of the Earth/Moon/Sun system. We determine a constant k and intermediate mass that bridges the macrocosmos to the microcosmos that predicts many things both on the atomic and astronomical and cosmological scales. It appears our moon orbiting the earth may have connections on the atomic and cosmological scales. We present the Solar System as quantum mechanical. In this second edition we come up with another equation for the radius of a proton independent of Avogadro’s number which gives us more equations for the unit of a second as natural to relate to the orbit of our Moon.</p>

<p><a href="SolarSystemQuantized.html">Click here to read The Solar System A Quantum Mechanical System (Oct 04 2023)</a></p>

<p>We utilize a curious equation I arrived at that gives one second nearly perfectly in terms of the atom. I find the same holds for the Earth/Moon/Sun orbital system. It is the orbital periods of these bodies upon which the calendar was developed since ancient times, so it is interesting that it comes up with the duration of a second so nicely that we find in terms of the proton and celestial orbits, here. I undertake to solve the calendar, to find the idea behind it that gives the second describing the proton and heavenly bodies like this. Most interestingly I show that the number six is six protons. This is important because the logical positivists whose set theory invented by Georg Cantor sought to explain the meaning of numbers as objects which in the end was a formal system and thus contradicted itself. They gave up on their set theory when Gödel published his Incompleteness Theorem, which showed all formal systems are based on at least one unprovable statement, and are thus incomplete. In solving the calendar we find why we have base 10 counting and it is not just because we have 10 fingers to count on.</p>

<p>We establish an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from which we derive a constant k that predicts the radius of a proton, its charge, the duration of the Universe, the Earth year or orbital period, and the Earth day or Earth rotation. It is based on the six-fold, which we also show predicts the skeletons of life chemistry, the hydrocarbons. The constant brings together the microcosmos and macrocosmos under one underlying principle. We show the second is a Natural unit, and it further predicts the units of the meter.</p>

<p>In the end of the paper we present the solar system as a quantum mechanical system and this results in the so-called Genesis Project equations. </p>
