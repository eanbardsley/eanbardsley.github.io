<p> This paper strives to address a question suggested by my theory that is whether life is part of a cosmic process. We have a theory for the Earth/Moon/Sun system as analogous to a quantum mechanical system for the atom. It uses a Planck constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system and it is related to the Planck constant, h, of quantum mechanics. It seems to produce Earth orbit as fundamental in its connection to the atom. We have to ask then if, since the Earth is connected to the atom as a physical system, does the theory apply to other star systems. If it does it would suggest life is part of a cosmic process, and we have to ask if it is, what is behind it. To answer whether life is part of a cosmic process, then, we have to see if what was found applies to other star systems with life-bearing worlds. While the data is scant and ballpark, we have some and are able to apply the formula to Kepler-452b which has a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of its star. The only problem is we currently can detect some planets around stars, but we can not yet resolve something like a moon orbiting an exoplanet because such a thing is far to small to resolve. We can, however, make an educated guess as to what its mass might be given the size of the planet it orbits. The formula involves the moon of a life-bearing world, and for a world to bear life it is believed it needs a moon to hold its inclination to its orbital plane, relatively steady. It may be our formula only holds for main sequence spectral-type G stars, like our Sun (or spectral types close to it). The majority of exoplanets so far detectable with current technology are spectral class M, red dwarf stars, more than likely because such stars are the most populous in our galaxy. The theory is in my paper The Sixfold Unfolding of the Universe and Life, Ian Beardsley, 2023.</p>

<p>If h_solar is connected to h_planck then Earth orbit is connected to the atom (KE_earth). If this is true of our solar system, is it true of other star systems for their life bearing worlds? It leaves one asking if life is part of some cosmic process is something behind it?<p>

<p>It took me several years; the truth is well hidden, but when revealed is sublime.<p>

<p> It is shown here that the Universe and life unfold in sixfold symmetry where the Earth-Moon-Sun system can be treated much the way quanta such as in the electron-proton system of the atom is treated, and that they are connected to one another. This is done by  introducing a Planck-type constant for the Earth-Moon-Sun system and relating it to that of quantum mechanics. The radius of a proton is predicted in agreement with experiment, and a constant k is developed that comes from an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements that we develop that is again sixfold in Nature. We find that the unit of a second is a natural base unit even though its historical development was not intended as such. With k we can predict the age of the Universe as given by the Friedmann model, the rotation period of the Earth (1 Day), and the Earth orbital period (1 year).</p>

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We donâ€™t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>

<p> This is the continuance of my paper A Precise Theory for the Proton Radius and the Elements as Mathematical Sets. Since we developed a theory for inertia that predicted the proton radius, and in doing this developed a Planck constant for the macrocosmos of the solar system connected to the microcosmos of atoms, and developed an equation of state for the periodic table and showed this includes the hydrocarbons, the backbones of life chemistry, we needed to now predict the amino acids, the building blocks of life. Then we predict ribose the fundamental sugar of life that is a primary component to DNA and RNA that provide the instructions for life. In writing this chapter in the project we found we had summarized the key talking points of the theory, that can be read separately. One would have to resort to the original complete paper to find the verifications of the equations. But essentially what we have here now is a clear picture of the role of the Universe in the emergence of life. Now that we have the amino acids and ribose, we need the purines, or nucleobases adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil, and the phosphate backbone DNA and RNA. The findings here may shed light on origins of life on Earth, the prebiotic path.</p>

<p><a href="proton_set_theory_08.html">Click here to read A Precise Theory for the Proton Radius and the Elements as Mathematical Sets Seventh Edition (Nov 14 2023)</a></p>

<p>In this the seventh edition we include now the hydrocarbons, amino acids, ribose, DNA and RNA</p>

<p>The proton is the fundamental charged particle that makes up atoms. We develop a theory of inertia with the proton as a 3d cross-section of a 4d hypersphere and suggest in terms of set theory that since no proton is unique that number of protons is actually number.  This describes the elements of the periodic table as sets of protons in a mathematical sense, and we suggest this is geared around six-fold symmetry in a way that optimizes the conditions for biological life. The radius of a proton is the least precise data value among the constants but new methods of measuring it are honing in on its actual value. If our set theory for the elements in terms of protons optimizes for life, then we have from our theory a value that is more within the current finest measurements. We also suggest the unit of a second is a natural unit as luck would have it, and that it occurs in the orbital elements of the Earth/Moon/Sun system. We determine a constant k and intermediate mass that bridges the macrocosmos to the microcosmos that predicts many things both on the atomic and astronomical and cosmological scales. It appears our moon orbiting the earth may have connections on the atomic and cosmological scales. We present the Solar System as quantum mechanical. In this second edition we come up with another equation for the radius of a proton independent of Avogadroâ€™s number which gives us more equations for the unit of a second as natural to relate to the orbit of our Moon.</p>

<p><a href="SolarSystemQuantized.html">Click here to read The Solar System A Quantum Mechanical System (Oct 04 2023)</a></p>

<p>We utilize a curious equation I arrived at that gives one second nearly perfectly in terms of the atom. I find the same holds for the Earth/Moon/Sun orbital system. It is the orbital periods of these bodies upon which the calendar was developed since ancient times, so it is interesting that it comes up with the duration of a second so nicely that we find in terms of the proton and celestial orbits, here. I undertake to solve the calendar, to find the idea behind it that gives the second describing the proton and heavenly bodies like this. Most interestingly I show that the number six is six protons. This is important because the logical positivists whose set theory invented by Georg Cantor sought to explain the meaning of numbers as objects which in the end was a formal system and thus contradicted itself. They gave up on their set theory when GÃ¶del published his Incompleteness Theorem, which showed all formal systems are based on at least one unprovable statement, and are thus incomplete. In solving the calendar we find why we have base 10 counting and it is not just because we have 10 fingers to count on.</p>

<p>We establish an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from which we derive a constant k that predicts the radius of a proton, its charge, the duration of the Universe, the Earth year or orbital period, and the Earth day or Earth rotation. It is based on the six-fold, which we also show predicts the skeletons of life chemistry, the hydrocarbons. The constant brings together the microcosmos and macrocosmos under one underlying principle. We show the second is a Natural unit, and it further predicts the units of the meter.</p>

<p>In the end of the paper we present the solar system as a quantum mechanical system and this results in the so-called Genesis Project equations.â€©</p>
