<p> A brief synopsis of the author’s theory for a wave solution of the Earth/Moon/Sun system that incorporates his theory for the atom’s proton is presented, wherein it is found these are described in terms of a characteristic time of one second. Then it is shown that in the context of this theory that the meter, second, and kilogram may be natural units for length, mass, and time, the basic units used to describe physical reality. As such it is necessary to the talk about the origins of a second with the ancient Sumerians that settled down from crafting stone into spearpoint to invent metallurgy, agriculture, writing, and mathematics; civilization in general.</p>

<p><a href="quantum_megalithic.html">Click here to read Angular Momentum, Quantum Gravity, and Megalithic Sites</a></p>

<p> It may be that the problem of reconciling gravity with quantum mechanics is an abstract problem, one that may have already been encountered by our ancient ancestors who erected stone observatories like Stonehenge (megalithic sites) and it may be that they found the solution in the megalithic yard, a unit of measurement for aligning stones. Presented here is the author’s earlier theory that provides a wave solution to the Earth/Moon/Sun system that is solved with a characteristic time of one second that is shown to solve also the atom’s proton. As such, it is suggested we can look at the Solar System, which is gravitational, to solve the quantum realm and provide a grand unified theory. It is suggested we might be able to help find such a solution by looking at ancient megalithic sites.</p>

<p>****************************************************************************************</p>

<h1>The Search For The Galactic Codex</h1>

<p>I have found that our Solar System has a fascinating mathematical structure underlying it. Our planet is an extraordinary example of a life bearing world. The mathematical structure I have found in my wave solution of the Solar system for the Earth/Moon/System could be taken as characteristic of a star like our Sun. Naturally, in discovering something about our solar system we would wonder if other star systems have a dynamic mathematical construction as well. As such, we would want to go to other star systems and survey their characteristics, and any ancient history of how other civilizations measured time and made calendars based on their observations of celestial motions like we did with ours. We might guess that other civilizations in the universe might discover such incredible mathematical structure underlying their planetary systems as well and would, once they could achieve interstellar travel, begin a survey of the mathematical structure behind star systems of other life bearing worlds and create a collection of them done throughout the galaxy, and they may have worked with other civilizations throughout the galaxy and compiled, if you will, a Galactic Codex. Some may even have achieved intergalactic travel and found the thumbprints not just characteristic of star-types but of galaxy-types. Let us look at what I have found our first entries could be in a galactic codex, which would be for the star system we know best, our Solar System. We begin with the characteristic time for our solution is one second and is given by the mass of the moon, \(M_m\), cubed:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\hbar_{\odot}^2}{GM_m^3}\cdot\frac{1}{c}=1\text{ second}$$</p>

<p>Yes, it does happen to be one second, our base unit of time we have today, ultimately given to us by the ancient Sumerians when they invented mathematics thousands of years ago. This becomes important, as we will see. The other extraordinary thing we find is that the Planck-type constant for our solar system is given by the kinetic energy of the Earth, the third planet where life is extraordinarily abundant, multiplied by one second.</p>

<p>$$\hbar_\odot=(1\text{ second})KE_e$$</p>

<p>We find life occurs so successfully when the Earth day is about what it is today (24 hours long) giving a characteristic time of close to one second in terms of the kinetic energy of the Moon and the Earth:</p>

<p>$$\frac{KE_m}{KE_e}(\text{EarthDay})= 1.1 - 1.3 \text{ seconds}$$</p>

<p>I also find that this characteristic time of one second is characteristic of the proton, the most fundamental unit that makes up matter, predicting its radius:</p>

<p>$$\left(\frac{1}{6\alpha^2}\sqrt{\frac{4\pi h}{Gc}}\right)\cdot\frac{r_p}{m_p}=1\text{ second}$$</p>

<p>$$\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{\pi r_p}{\alpha^4Gm_p^3}}\right)\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{h}{c}=1\text{ second}$$</p>

<p>Where \(r_p\) and \(m_p\) are the radius and mass of a proton. Equating these two gives about the radius of a proton:</p>

<p>$$r_p=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{h}{cm_p}$$</p>

<p>The ancient Sumerians were responsible for giving us the unit of a second because they divided the earth’s rotation period, its day, into 24 hours, and the ancient Babylonians divided each hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, from the ancient Sumerians base 60 mathematics. Perhaps the most exciting entry in our galactic codex is:</p>

<p>$$\frac{L_{earth}}{\hbar_\odot}24=60$$</p>

<p>Where \(L_{earth}\) is the rotational angular momentum of the Earth. This specifies not only is the rotation period of the Earth best measured by dividing the day into 24 units and 60 units, but that such an optimization includes the mass and radius of the Earth. Another exciting entry in our galactic codex is that during the time in the Earth’s history when the day is about 24 hours which specifies close to a second from the kinetic energies of the Earth and Moon, the Moon perfectly eclipsing the Sun as seen from the Earth, holds:</p>

<p>$$\frac{r_{planet}}{r_{moon}}=\frac{R_{star}}{R_{moon}}$$</p>

<p>\(r_{planet}\) is the orbital radius of the Earth, \(r_{moon}\) is the orbital radius of the Moon, \(R_{star}\) is the radius of the Sun, and \(R_{moon}\) is the radius of the Moon. There is a lot more that we will find in the course of this paper regarding the exciting entries to be made in this Galactic Codex. We will even find, with astronomy being what it is today, that we can begin to make entries in the codex for other star systems. But of course, to really understand such star systems, we want to go to them, and survey them not just physically, but archaeologically.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in our radio astronomy search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) one of the transmissions we might receive might be not just the physical characteristics for their star and planet, but a Galactic Codex for many star systems. We even may be able to find traces of a galactic codex here on earth now, left in the ruins of archaeological sites. Such examples could be in clay Sumerian cuneiform tablets or in the megalithic yard which was perhaps a standard length used to construct megalithic sites, like Stonehenge. We will look at that, too, in this paper.</p>

<p><a href="second.html">Click here to read Describing Everything In The Universe From The Big Bang, To The Proton, To The Protoplanetary Disc, To The Solar System, To Life With One Value, The Unit Of A Second Of Time</a></p>

<p> It is reported here that planetary and atomic scales (the proton) may be described by a characteristic time of about 1 second, where the second we have today comes from the ancient Sumerians having divided the Earth rotation period into 24 units (hours) and their base 60 counting system that ultimately resulted in dividing the hour into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds. We find the ground state of the our solar system is based on the mass of the Moon, and that the algebraic condition for the Moon nearly perfectly eclipsing the Sun may be a condition for optimal habitability of earth-like planets in habitable zones in general. It is found from a relationship in Vedic yoga that an equation exists for the radius of the habitable planet that produces a planetary radius for all spectral-types of stars about that of the Earth. It is suggested that perhaps this size, owing to its gravity, might be ideal for life chemistry to take place based on elemental properties. It is found that our characteristic time of one second, yielding the proton radius closely, and describing our Solar System, may have been inherited from the Big Bang, and that the the protoplanetary disc that gave rise to the the planets may have inherited this characteristic time from the Big Bang as well. We find the characteristic time of one second follows from not just the Sumerian quantization of time into (24, 60) for the earth rotation but that this works with the radius and mass of the Earth, which results in a quantization of angular momentum for the Solar System.. We also find that 1 second encodes for the core element of life, carbon. In short, we can encode everything in the Universe from the Big Bang, to the proton, to the protoplanetary disc, to the Solar System, to life with one unit, a second of time.</p>

<p>The rudiments for a theory of planetary and atomic systems bridging macro-scales (planetary systems) with micro-scales (the atom’s proton) is achieved through a wave equation solution of our Solar System that is used to describe atoms in quantum mechanics. We find the base unit of time, the characteristic time, in the solution for our Solar System and the atom comes out to be the base unit of time developed since ancient times by the ancient Sumerians and Babylonians of one second. Applying this theory to multiple star systems reveals that the optimal conditions for life may be intersecting at Earth-like star systems. It is suggested that stars that host planets that are good hosts for intelligent life to develop begins at around spectral class F stars to spectral class K stars on the main sequence with the optimal conditions intersecting between these two around spectral class G stars in the area of our star, the Sun. Moons of planets are shown to play a key role in the wave solution for the star systems and turn out to define their ground state if they are habitable. Our moon plays a primary role in allowing for life on the Earth, stabilizing its orbit allowing for the seasons. It may be the conditions for complex life maximize during the epoch where a moon perfectly eclipses the star it orbits as seen from the habitable planet which determines some forms of the equations that give the characteristic time of the star system at or around 1 second. The characteristic time of 1 second common to the Solar System and atomic systems appears to be characteristic, as well, of hydrocarbons the skeletons of life chemistry in a context of sixfold symmetry. An in depth look at the moon eclipsing the Sun as seen from the Earth over geologic times is given. In section 12.0 and 13.0 we present the ideal method for modeling habitable star systems with our theory. There is not one kind of planet for any particular orbit that is the only one possible; you can have many kinds of planets form for a given type of star. We conclude that the intersection of an atomic and planetary science happens with habitable systems like the one that belongs to our Sun, a so-called G2V star system and within a range from F to K stars, the G stars being of the type that includes our Sun, which is in-between the two. This seems to happen in a star system where there are perfect eclipses of the star by the moon, as occurs in our Solar System. We successfully model from F8V stars to G8V stars with a computer program applying the ideal method. We find the so called PlanetDay characteristic time intersects with the characteristic time around the G0V stars, and that all three characteristic times, that is including that of the proton, come closest to intersecting at around stars like our Sun, G2V. We also look at the origins of the second from the ancient Sumerians and see that it may be the idea behind its development has something to do with it being the characteristic times in star systems and atoms.</p>

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We don’t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>
