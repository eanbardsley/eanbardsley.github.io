<p>Here I present my findings that the solar system mirrors atomic systems and has a quantum mechanical solution to the Schrödinger wave equation based on a base unit of 1 second. I further suggest that this solution for our spectral class G2V star the Sun, may indicate that life is a uniform cosmic unfolding throughout the Universe. In order to test whether this works for many G2V star like our Sun we would need to detect Earth sized planets around such other such stars, to see if my Planck constant works for other planetary systems, which I show is connected to the my theory for the radius of a proton in terms the Natural constants such as the gravitational constant for gravity and the Planck constant for atoms. However the first Earth-sized planets have been detected in the habitable zones of stars, and interestingly there are 4 planets in a red dwarf spectral class M star in the habitable zone of a star designated TOI 700 with complete data and fairly small margins of error. Two of them are Earth-sized, but the star is not spectral class G2V like our Sun. However, before that we detected an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of a G2V star like our Sun, but it was not Earth-sized, but rather a super-Earth, which is to say it was much more massive than the Earth, estimated 5 times more massive. And this figure for the mass was an estimate, where for our Earth-sized planets around an M star are well determined. The star for the super-Earth is called Kepler-452 and the planet is called Kepler-452b. We will not work with this one in the paper, as the data is not accurate enough for the size and mass of the planet because the system is so far away. Lightly suggested in this study is the progression from cool red M stars to warm yellow G stars to hot blue A stars in association with a progression from one type of life to another.</p>

<p> Part 1: Here I present my findings that the solar system mirrors atomic systems and has a quantum mechanical solution to the Schrödinger wave equation based on a base unit of 1 second. I further suggest that this solution for our spectral class G2V star the Sun, may indicate that life is a uniform cosmic unfolding throughout the Universe. In this age where we are able to now infer planets around other stars, including Earth-like planets in the habitable zones, and can obtain some of the orbital data, that this theory can soon be tested, because major efforts are underway to build better telescopes and equipment for such inferences, and the the James Webb space telescope has already been employed and is being geared up for such jobs.</p>

<p> Part 2: I introduce a constant k that functions both on the cosmological scale and on the atomic scale. To do this I introduce an intermediary mass in the universe that is the geometric mean between the mass of a proton and the limit in mass for a star to collapse into a white dwarf star without collapsing into a black hole, the Chandrasekhar limit. We find to do this we need to introduce an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements.</p>

<p> Part 3: We connect parts 1 and parts 2.</p>

<p> Part 4: We find the solution to the wave equation for Earth for the rest of the planets. Here we notice that this suggests the possibility of a Genesis Matrix.</p>

<p> Appendix 1: This paper uses the Chandrasekhar Limit for a white dwarf star. Here we explain it.</p>

<p> Appendix 2: This paper uses the Van Der Waals Radius for a hydrogen atom. Here we explain it.</p>

<p> Historically the hydrogen atom was modeled by Bohr with data of it from observation. Later the Schrödinger wave equation was solved for the hydrogen atom to obtain the same results. In our attempt here to model star systems as quantum mechanical systems we can do the same because we have observations of our solar system. The Schrödinger equation models the Bohr atom for a particle in a bounded sphere and here we are looking at planets not in a sphere but in a disc. Work has been done for the Schrödinger evolution of self gravitating discs. In fact it has been shown since the 1960’s that the Schrödinger equation follows from classical mechanics quite simply from the Hamiltonian formulation of Newton’s laws. But solving it is quite another matter for a disc of particles in a gravitational well. Really, for the hydrogen atom we only have one particle around a proton, and though this can be solved and explain Bohr and the periodic table, it can be impossible for atoms with more than one electron around a nucleus of several protons. However, in this paper we have found a Planck constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system that solves it, so we would be wise to take Bohr’s shortcut at this point, considering the overwhelming complexity of billions of particles in a gravitating disc. This can be done because the Bohr model takes an electron around a proton as a circular orbit and that is what the Earth is around the Sun. It has be taken as an analogy, and not the same, because planetary systems are very different than atoms. For instance electrons can jump from one orbit to another and planets don’t. We find the Planck constant developed in Part 1 does solve a wave equation for the Earth/Moon/Sun system. </p>
<p>It is shown here that the Universe and life unfold in sixfold symmetry where the Earth-Moon-Sun system can be treated much the way quanta such as in the electron-proton system of the atom is treated, and that they are connected to one another. This is done by  introducing a Planck-type constant for the Earth-Moon-Sun system and relating it to that of quantum mechanics. The radius of a proton is predicted in agreement with experiment, and a constant k is developed that comes from an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements that we develop that is again sixfold in Nature. We find that the unit of a second is a natural base unit even though its historical development was not intended as such. With k we can predict the age of the Universe as given by the Friedmann model, the rotation period of the Earth (1 Day), and the Earth orbital period (1 year).  The Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars and the Van Der Waals radius for a hydrogen atom are used in this paper, their theories are in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 respectively. If the solar Planck constant is equal to that of quantum mechanics by a factor of the kinetic energy of the Earth, we are left asking if something like this works for our solar system does it work for other star systems. If it does, then we ask is life part of some cosmic process. We can only answer this when more refined data comes in for earth-like exoplanets around other stars, and the ability to detect moons around these exoplanets because the unit of a second involves the kinetic energy of the Earth’s moon as well. Further we are able to show that our equations yield number as form, which is to say we can put things in set theory to show that one is one object, and that object is a proton, one of the fundamental units for building everything.</p>

<p><a href="exoanthropology.html">Click here to read A Proposal In Exoanthropology (Updated December 04 2023)</a></p>

<p> Exoanthropology is not a subject today but I thought the word best described what I am doing here. Exopolitics is a word and describes the politics we have with extraterrestrial civilizations if they exist, so there are those people who believe they are actively involved with the politics of other worlds. Exobiology is a word as well, which is the biology of not just the Earth but includes speculation on the biology of life throughout the Universe, also known as astrobiology. We can detect planets around other star systems now, but because of their great distances the data is incomplete and the systems cannot be entirely solved, especially for their moons if they exist. This paper uses a theory I developed about reality that treats the Earth/Moon/Sun system the way we treat an atom, quantum mechanically. As such I have introduced a Planck-type constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system and connected it with that of the atom. The result is that I can solve exoplanetary systems without all of the information. This in fact depends on their being a moon for Earth-like planets in the habitable zones for other stars. It is believed that life bearing planets should have moons, because ours makes life on Earth possible. I use anthropology because I draw upon anthropological concepts, and ultimately to solve the system of an Earth-like exoplanet is to find its calendar as developed by an off-world civilization. In this paper I solve the system for the star Kepler-452 which is a spectral class G star like our Sun with a giant Earth-like planet in its habitable zone.</p>

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We don’t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>
