<p>The rudiments for a theory of planetary and atomic systems bridging macro-scales (planetary systems) with micro-scales (the atom’s proton) is achieved through a wave equation solution of our Solar System that is used to describe atoms in quantum mechanics. We find the base unit of time, the characteristic time, in the solution for our Solar System and the atom comes out to be the base unit of time developed since ancient times by the ancient Sumerians and Babylonians of one second. Applying this theory to multiple star systems reveals that the optimal conditions for life may be intersecting at Earth-like star systems. It is suggested that stars that host planets that are good hosts for intelligent life to develop begins at around spectral class F stars to spectral class K stars on the main sequence with the optimal conditions intersecting between these two around spectral class G stars in the area of our star, the Sun. Moons of planets are shown to play a key role in the wave solution for the star systems and turn out to define their ground state if they are habitable. Our moon plays a primary role in allowing for life on the Earth, stabilizing its orbit allowing for the seasons. It may be the conditions for complex life maximize during the epoch where a moon perfectly eclipses the star it orbits as seen from the habitable planet which determines some forms of the equations that give the characteristic time of the star system at or around 1 second. The characteristic time of 1 second common to the Solar System and atomic systems appears to be characteristic, as well, of hydrocarbons the skeletons of life chemistry in a context of sixfold symmetry. An in depth look at the moon eclipsing the Sun as seen from the Earth over geologic times is given. In section 12.0 and 13.0 we present the ideal method for modeling habitable star systems with our theory. There is not one kind of planet for any particular orbit that is the only one possible; you can have many kinds of planets form for a given type of star. We conclude that the intersection of an atomic and planetary science happens with habitable systems like the one that belongs to our Sun, a so-called G2V star system and within a range from F to K stars, the G stars being of the type that includes our Sun, which is in-between the two. This seems to happen in a star system where there are perfect eclipses of the star by the moon, as occurs in our Solar System. We successfully model from F8V stars to G8V stars with a computer program applying the ideal method. We find the so called PlanetDay characteristic time intersects with the characteristic time around the G0V stars, and that all three characteristic times, that is including that of the proton, come closest to intersecting at around stars like our Sun, G2V. We also look at the origins of the second from the ancient Sumerians and see that it may be the idea behind its development has something to do with it being the characteristic times in star systems and atoms.</p>

<p>My theory has something to do with why we would be going into space, which indicates it might be in part to find out if other star systems have dynamic relationships with protons that make up atoms and both those with time as measured in their calendars by dynamic mathematical relationships that may exist in the motions of their planets and their moons as is the case with our star system, The Solar System. My theory shows we have this with our star system, and would suggest we need to find other star systems with habitable planets to see if they have them and relate them to ours if they do so as to reveal a higher truth as to how and why we are here, and what our purpose might be.</p>

UFOs in 1952 hovered over the capitol for two weekends, fighter jets were scrambled. Washington is at the same 37 parallel that I found connected to UFO activity and is the path of the star vega (See above paper). I just learned about this and it turns out since then the US has built its important facilities on that latitude, including Area 51.

<p>Do The Moonmakers Exist And Is The Moon Important?</p>

My paper “The Earth A Habitable Planet As A Solution To The Wave Equation” solves our planetary system with the Schrödinger wave equation. It may even solve what it means to have habitable star systems in general and leads me to consider the possible existence of what we could call “The Moonmakers”.</p>

<p>If the Earth Day gets longer, it will have less cooling and get warmer. If the Moon’s orbit gets larger it may be it will less effectively hold the Earth’s tilt to the Sun, and we could lose the seasons and end up with temperature extremes bad for life. It may be that a condition for complex intelligent life on Earth is:</p>

<p>r_planet/r_moon = R_star/R_moon</p>

<p>The more immediate problem before us is catastrophic climate change (global warming). Since the industrial revolution we have greatly increased the amount of the heat retaining gas CO2 in the atmosphere. Parts per billion have gone up from about 200 to 400. Trees make some of this and some of it is necessary, or the Earth would get to cool, but too much, the tipping point is considered 350, and the Earth will warm beyond what is necessary for life to be as successful as it has been. A less immediate problem is the Sun is warming by very small amounts over time. In 2 billion years it would warm to the point that it would boil away the oceans. A star with the mass of our Sun will stay on the main sequence for 10 billion years, after which it will deplete its fuel and and expand beyond Earth orbit and start burning the by-products of its earlier fuel. This should happen in about 5 billion years, at which point it would seem Mars, further away from the Sun than the Earth, might become the habitable planet. A star with half the mass of our Sun, a red dwarf, can last 80 to 100 billion years on the main sequence, longer than the current age of the Universe 13.8 billion years. We have found an Earth sized planet in the habitable zone of such a star, the TOI 700 system, and we expect to find a lot more. Red dwarf stars are the most populous in our galaxy. However, because they are cooler, the habitable zone is closer in, meaning the planets are probably tidally locked with the stars they orbit, meaning their days are the same as their year, just as the day of our moon is the same as its month, these bodies always having the same face toward what they orbit. Thus for a habitable planet around a red dwarf, one side is always extremely hot and the other extremely cold. The habitable region of such a planet would be where night meets day on its surface, the twilight zone.</p>

<p>There is a great mystery surrounding our moon, it has a very low density, meaning it has a low mass for its size, and it is considered very large and massive for the Moon of a terrestrial planet like the Earth, which is more typical of a moon orbiting a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn.</p>

<p>Because of the strange mass of the Moon and its unusual occurrence around a planet like the Earth, and its unusually nearly perfect circular orbit, it has been suggested by some scientists to be hollow, even a hollow spacecraft, put there to help life by holding the Earth at its tilt to its orbit. When we went to the Moon, NASA dropped the launch stage for the lander on the Moon, and they measured the seismic activity. It rang for an hour like a bell, as if it were hollow. The Earth doesn’t do this, some say because of all the water on its surface dampening it, others say only something hollow could ring like that.</p>

<p>This makes me think of a science fiction short story be Arthur C. Clarke, The Sentinel, which was the precursor to the movie 2001. It had in the first mission to the Moon, two astronauts finding a glistening object atop a mountain on the Moon. They climbed up to it and broke the protection barrier surrounding the sentinel, which was a large monolith monitoring Earth. They said call Earth and tell them to expect visitors. They realized in breaking the seal, it would stop communication of the sentinel with its makers, making them aware that we figured out how to get from Earth to the Moon.</p>

<p>In 2001 the movie large monoliths were put on the Earth and the Moon to monitor human progress. The monolith makers seeded the Universe with life and put monoliths on the planets to monitor the progress of life and to give it evolutionary nudges when needed. Perhaps the Moonmakers, if they exist, if our Moon is really a hollow spacecraft holding the Earth at its tilt to its orbit to make life possible, perhaps they put it there because we are supposed to figure that out, go there, enter the craft and move the Moon when needed to be in an orbit that counters the factors that are not beneficial to life that are underway. Perhaps the Moon is something that can be moved to adjust the climate of the Earth.</p>

<p>Our equation in this paper for the Earth orbit does not depend on the Moon’s distance from the Earth, only its mass. The Moon slows the Earth rotation and this in turn expands the Moon’s orbit, so it is getting larger, the Earth loses energy to the Moon. The Earth day gets longer by 0.0067 hours per million years, and the Moon’s orbit gets 3.78 cm larger per year.</p> 

<p>Our wave equation solution may only use the Moon’s mass but the equation for kinetic energy of the Moon to kinetic energy of the Earth times the Earth Day equal to about one second:</p>

<p>(KE_moon/KE_earth)(EarthDay)=1.08 seconds</p>

<p>which we connect with the equation where the proton gives one second:</p>

<p>Equation In Proton Radius and Proton mass gives one second.</p>

<p>This holds for when the Moon was at a distance from the Earth such that it appears the same size as the Sun, which means:</p>

<p>r_planet/r_moon = R_star/R_moon</p>

Which is when the two equations above for one second connect to our wave equation solution to the Earth.

<p>KE_planet=(sqrt(n))(R_star/R_moon)(G,M_planet,M_moon,h_star)</p>

<p>The Moon at its inclination to the Earth in its orbit makes life possible here because it holds the Earth at its tilt to its orbit around the Sun allowing for the seasons so the Earth doesn’t get too extremely hot or too extremely cold. We see the Moon may be there for a reason.</p>

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We don’t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>
