<p>If ever there was something to strongly indicate that life on Earth is the result of design by a thinking entity or entities it is that the solution to to the Schrödinger wave equation for atomic orbital systems has a solution for our planetary system as an orbital system that is quantized in terms of the Earth’s Moon and a base unit of 1 second. The Moon has long been thought to not make sense: it has an unusually low density, and unusually large size for a moon of a terrestrial planet. It’s orbit is a nearly perfect circle, and its size is such that as seen from the Earth it near perfectly eclipses the Sun. The Moon makes life on Earth possible, its orbit holds the Earth at its inclination to the Sun in its orbit so as to allow for the seasons and prevent temperature extremes. This unit of one second that is the basis for our quantum mechanical solution of the Earth/Moon/Sun system also describes the proton, the fundamental unit of mass that makes up the elements. The unit of a second was not thought out in terms of the Solar System and proton, but rather came from ancient times. The Ancient Sumerians, who settled down from following the herds and hunting to give us mathematics, writing, agriculture, metallurgy,… divided the motions of the stars due to the Earth’s rotation in base 60 (sexagesimal) as well as the degrees in a circle, and base 60 has many mathematical properties that are convenient and and we see that they describe the properties of Nature. From this the Sumerians gave us the unit of a second and degrees in a circle, and it may be why the unit of a second coincides with the quantization of the Earth/Moon/Sun system and the radius to mass of the proton. The anomalous nature of the Moon has lead some scientists to suggest that it is a hollow, artificial structure, even a spacecraft put there for a reason by forces unknown. Whether it is a hollow artificial structure or not I show in my paper <I>The Earth A Habitable Planet As A Solution To The Wave Equation</I> that it works as some kind of a <I>Natural Yardstick</I> that conveniently solves our solar system as the solution to a wave equation. If ever we wanted to resolve the mystery of life on the Earth, I would think we would want to explore this strange occurrence of the Earth/Moon/Sun system being quantized in terms of the Moon and fundamental base unit of 1 second.</p>

<p> We find a0, the Bohr radius for the planets. It occurs at Mercury orbit as it should because this is orbit n=1 and the Bohr radius is the most probable place to find an electron orbiting a proton in the ground state. We put this in the wave equation for the hydrogen atom and get the probability that Mercury should be found at any time between the center of the Sun and Venus, the n=2 orbit which is 100% as it should be because planets don't jump around in their orbits like electrons do.Our Planck constant for the planets continues to work across the board.</p>

<p> We want to solve a habitable planetary system in general and apply it to another star system. We must include the solution of its moon as well, because the Moon of the Earth makes life optimally possible. However, our Moon is counter-intuitive, it breaks all of the rules of the other moons in our solar system. One is it has a low mass for its size. It has been said that it could be hollow. Even suggested that it is a hollow-spacecraft put there to make life as we know it possible. In our quantum theory for the solar system, we may have discovered the science of the engineers who may have made the Moon, and we are possibly applying their science here. Our quantum theory for the solar system also has a solar solution as compared to a lunar solution, so it works for star systems in general.</p>

<p>The perfect star system to use for our purposes here would be Tau Ceti. Tau Ceti is a star spectrally similar to the Sun and the closest of such a G-class star, at about 12 light years distant. Its mass is 78% of the Sun’s.</p>

<p>The theory from which these equations were obtained is in the paper:</p>

I added a couple chapters to the paper 11.0 and 12.0. In 11.0 I come up with the equation that shows the how the atom as an orbital system is a reflection of the Earth/Moon/Sun system as an orbital system. In 12.0 I derive from that why the historical second coincides with the physical second as a base unit of time. The paper is at:

<p> It would seem the Earth/Moon/Sun system and the atom with its proton can be conveniently formulated in terms of a base unit of one second, which results in a solution to the quantum mechanical wave equation of Schrödinger of atoms as orbital systems for the planets and the Sun as an orbital system. It would seem the Moon is a perfect yardstick for formulating reality, which is curious because the Moon makes life on Earth possible because its mysterious size and near perfectly circular orbit hold the Earth at its inclination to the Sun allowing for the seasons preventing extreme hot and cold. The Moon is a mystery in astronomy, it is almost as if it should not be there. One example of this is its low mass for its size, which has lead some to say it is hollow. If it is, then then it has to have an artificial structure beneath its surface keeping it from collapsing. This has lead to some suggesting it is a spacecraft that came here a long time ago. It is as if thought went into its design, and this might explain why it allows for the wave solution of the solar system presented in this paper. Aside from my formulation in terms of the Moon, I present a solar solution as well. The base unit of one second is intriguing as well; its origins are historical, not physical yet it becomes the basis of physical dynamics in this paper. I suggest why that historical development of such a unit of time, which ultimately came to us from the Ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia, who were of the first to settle down from wandering and hunting to invent agriculture, mathematics, and writing, may have aligned with physics because one can find a sixfold property to it evolution, and Nature seems to be conveniently formulated in terms of the sixfold. One of the advantages to our quantum mechanical solution of star systems from the Schrödinger wave equation may be that in its application to the asteroid belt, it may be able to find the probability of when and where an asteroid will be ejected from the belt and put on a possible collision course with the Earth. One could easily be compelled to suggest whatever might be behind the Moon as a hollow craft, might be behind the historical development of the unit of second as the base unit to our calendar. I further show that the base unit of a second found in the atom’s proton is in the hydrocarbons, the chemical skeletons of life chemistry.</p>

<p>************************************************************************************</p>

<p>(February 29 2024)</p>

<p>I find the unit of a second occurs as a natural basis in my wave solution of the planets. I find that interesting because the second comes from historically (Since Ancient Times) dividing the earth rotation by 24, 60, and 60 again (24 hours, 60 min/hour, 60 sec/min). But I find it also involves the Moon and the proton. For the Moon</p>

<p>(KE_moon/KE_earth)(EarthDay)=1 second</p>

<p>The Earth day, of course, is the Earth rotation period. The Moon seems to be a Natural yardstick in my equations that makes everything work. For instance the Sun is radius 400 in terms of the Moon, and the Moon is 400 times further from the Sun than the Earth, and this allows for a perfect eclipse.</p>

<p>The Moon is anomalous and has been a mystery in astronomy for some time, it is considered very large for the moon of a terrestrial planet.  It has a very low mass for its size, even NASA scientists say it is as if it is hollow. It has a near perfectly circular orbit, and it makes life possible on Earth because it holds the Earth at its tilt to the Sun preventing temperature extremes and allowing for the seasons. Other planets have their tilt always changing, even going completely on their side at times. It is as if someone or something put the Moon there for a reason. If so it may be that the perfect dimensions of it that allow for my QM solution to work may have somehow been designed into it by someone or something, forces unknown. Mystery.</p>

<p>What I have have done here is to work out the basics, a sort of foundation upon which to build. Now that that is laid, I have a lot more to do. First on my list is to derive the solution of the wave equation for gravity directly. Here I used the Bohr solution which Bohr just wrote down when he suggested the atom was quantized discretely. His solution was later derived from the wave equation. But I know what I have done is right (using the Moon) because page 11 section 5.0 shows the planetary Planck constant is right from the delocalization time for the Earth orbit from the standard solution of a gaussian wave packet using the moon orbital radius to find the Earth year.</p>

<p>I need to write out the wave equation because my guess is there are two waves on either side of the asteroid belt; one for the terrestrial planets, the other for the gas giants, because I need to combine these two wave functions to get their interference patterns which should be at the asteroid belt. I would then need, and I don't know where to get it, but the right math software to plot the interference patterns so their images can be studied for when and where asteroids could be ejected from the belt, and possibly go on a collision course with the Earth. This seems to me to be an overwhelming task, and I am not sure that it is the right approach.</p>

<p>I am new to Quantum Mechanics, so I am solving the wave equation for the first time in the application to gravity as opposed to the electric forces, and I am confident I can do that because they are both inverse square laws, and for the hydrogen atom the solution has been well established. However, there is something different going on with the planets than with atoms because with atoms you have protons orbited by electrons and that is in the solution, but with planets you have planets orbiting the Sun and the masses of the planets are different than each other where with electrons they are all the same size, mass, and charge, but it can be done because the solution instead has for say the Earth orbiting the Sun, or any other planet orbiting the Sun, the Moon of the Earth as the common mass in the solution, so while that makes it possible, the solution method will diverge from the atom with that factor as the function of the system. I don't know when I am going to find the time to do this.</p>

<p>I am excited to get to this because maybe I can find out why everything is based on the Moon, and why it is there when many scientists have said it shouldn't be, and why it determines the unit of a second that we happened to coincidentally develop, which came from the Ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia with their choice of base 60 counting. Obviously, if the Moon has so low a mass for its size and it is hollow, then to not collapse, it would have an artificial structure beneath supporting it. This was suggested by a couple Russian scientists, that it is a spacecraft that came here long ago and was put into orbit around Earth. That gets at why there is life on Earth and who are what might be responsible for it because life on Earth depends on the Moon orbiting it.</p>

Predicting Asteroid Impacts (February 20 2024)

<p>One of the applications of my theory in “Our Solar System As A Solution Of The Quantum Mechanical Wave Equation” is that it might help in giving us an idea of when and where to look for the impact on Earth of a possibly cataclysmic asteroid or meteor.</p>

<p>The theory being quantum mechanical is statistical, means it deals in frequencies. Asteroids and meteor impacts on Earth have frequencies however they are probabilities, but quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory. It may be possible that my theory could be useful in finding when probabilities are high for asteroid or meteor impacts on Earth, giving us an idea of when and where to look.</p>

<p>Early detection in potential asteroids or meteors on a trajectory that could intersect with the Earth trajectory is crucial for the obvious reason that changing the trajectory of an asteroid or meteor when it is far away by a small amount with a nuclear blast means the change in its position when it gets near us will be greater.</p>

<p>I have started thinking about an approach to this but I really feel it would be very complicated and require experts in the field of asteroids and the asteroid belt, and quantum mechanics, with  much better resources such as sophisticated computers and software.</p>

<p>The asteroid that ended the dinosaurs 65 million years ago hitting in Yucatan was probably only a couple miles to four miles across and probably came from the asteroid belt, but the major damage comes from it kicking up dust and dirt into the atmosphere that distributes around the globe blocking sunlight thus resulting in lack of food from vegetation dying off.</p>

<p> This is mostly a paper about the solution for our solar system of the wave equation that describes atoms as orbital systems. However finding it is centered on the moon that orbits our planet, it has become sensical to apply it to the Moon as a hollow-sphere spacecraft. It seems a lot to suggest that the Moon was put there by aliens and is a hollow-sphere craft, but oddly it describes it better than traditional theories because as astronomers have long known, the Moon does not make sense.</p>

<p>****************************************************************************************</p>

<p>As hard as it is to believe it would seem a fringe idea explains the Moon better than the mainstream understanding of orbiting bodies, like accretion, capture, and collision theories. My theory where I solve our solar system as a solution of the Schrödinger wave equation used to solve atoms, is based on the Moon’s mass making it work for the whole solar system nicely. I find both the protons of atoms and the Moon are both mysteriously related to the duration of one second that we use to measure time which was not based on their physics but on the way the ancients developed our calendar. Looking into the Moon further you find the Moon makes no sense, that it is in the reverse of the Earth and all the planets in many ways. The rocks on the surface of the Moon are denser than the rocks below which would better be explained if the Moon was hollow. There is further evidence that the Moon is hollow. Like the rocks on the surface of the Moon are older than the rock below it, and when we went to the Moon and returned to the command module we dropped the lunar lander on the Moon and measured the seismic activity, the result was the it rang like a bell for an hour which again is explained better by a hollow moon, that it reverberates like a bell. Some rocks on the Moon are older than not just the Earth, but than the solar system, and are magnetized yet the Moon doesn’t have a magnetic field. Chromium, Titanium, and Zirconium are abundant on the Moon but not on the Earth, and if the the Moon was hollow these are the metals you would use to reinforce such a structure because they are some of the strongest elements and they resist corrosion. Also the craters formed by meteor impacts on the Moon are all the same depth regardless of their sizes as if there is a resilient shell beneath the surface. The low density of the Moon would also be explained by it being a hollow shell. Two Soviet scientists considered all of this and more said as crazy as it sounds the only logical explanation for the Moon is that is was a hollow space craft that came here in the distant past. One of the strange things is that my solution for the wave equation based on the Moon for the whole solar system is that the Moon perfectly eclipses the Sun as see from the Earth because it is the right size. We know the Moon allows for life on Earth because it holds the Earth at its tilt to its orbit around the Sun allowing for seasons preventing cold or hot temperature extremes. Also many ancient cultures refer to a time when there was not Moon and this seems to place when it appeared anthropologically around 11,500 to 13,000 years ago.</p>

<p>I wondered what simulation theory would imply for my theory, so I had the following conversation with Chat GPT</p>

<p><a href="life_natural_property.html">Click here to read Life As A Natural Property of the Universe (January 18 2024)</a></p>

<p>Me</p>

<p>Is the observer rendered in simulation theory</p>
<p>Chat GPT</p>
<p>In simulation theory, the idea is that our reality, including ourselves as observers, could be a simulated or artificial construct. The question of whether the observer is "rendered" in simulation theory involves the concept that our consciousness, thoughts, and perceptions could be part of the simulation.</p>
<p>Simulation theory posits that an advanced civilization, possibly far in the future, has created a computer simulation that accurately replicates a reality similar to ours. Within this simulated reality, everything, including the observer (you and me), would be part of the simulated construct.</p>
<p>The nature of consciousness and the observer in simulation theory is a topic of philosophical and scientific debate. Some proponents argue that consciousness itself may be simulated, while others suggest that consciousness is fundamental and cannot be replicated within a simulation. Ultimately, it's a speculative idea without empirical evidence at this point, and various interpretations and hypotheses exist within the context of simulation theory.</p>

<p>ME</p>

<p>are we outside interacting with the simulation</p>

<p>Chat GPT</p>

<p>In the context of simulation theory, the idea that we are "outside" interacting with the simulation refers to the notion that there might be a higher or external reality beyond the simulated construct in which we exist. This higher reality could be inhabited by beings or entities that have created or are overseeing the simulation.</p>
<p>In this scenario, our consciousness and experiences within the simulated world would be part of the simulation, and the entities outside the simulation might have control or influence over the simulated environment. This idea is often associated with the concept of a simulation hypothesis, which suggests that our perceived reality is a computer-generated simulation created by a more advanced civilization.</p>
<p>It's important to note that simulation theory is speculative and lacks empirical evidence. While it can be a fascinating topic for philosophical and theoretical discussions, it is not currently supported by scientific consensus, and alternative explanations for the nature of reality exist.</p>

<p>ME</p>

<p>In simulation theory where to we, the observers, come from</p>

<p>Chat GPT</p>

<p>In simulation theory, the origin of the observers (us) is often attributed to the external reality or the higher-level civilization that supposedly created the simulation. According to this speculative hypothesis, the beings or entities in the external reality are responsible for generating the simulated universe, including its inhabitants and observers.</p>
<p>In this framework, the consciousness, experiences, and perceptions of individuals within the simulation are considered part of the simulated construct. The observers themselves, in this scenario, would not have an independent existence outside the simulation but would be entities within the simulated world.</p>
<p>It's important to emphasize that simulation theory is a speculative concept and currently lacks empirical evidence. The idea raises various philosophical and existential questions, and it is not universally accepted within the scientific community. Different interpretations and variations of simulation theory exist, and the discussion often revolves around the nature of consciousness, reality, and the potential capabilities of a hypothetical advanced civilization creating such a simulation.</p>

<p>ME</p>

<p>what is the reason for a higher intelligence or civilization to create the simulation</p>

<p>Chat GPT</p>

<p>The reasons that might be attributed to a higher intelligence or civilization creating a simulated reality are largely speculative, as simulation theory itself is a concept that currently lacks empirical evidence. However, proponents of simulation theory and related hypotheses have proposed several speculative reasons for why a more advanced civilization might create a simulated universe. Some of these hypothetical motivations include:</p>
	<p>Research or Experimentation: The creators of the simulation could be conducting a scientific experiment or research to better understand their own reality or to explore the consequences of different physical laws, scenarios, or evolutionary processes.</p>
	<p>Entertainment: The simulation might serve as a form of entertainment for the creators. Much like how we create virtual worlds and simulations for entertainment purposes, a more advanced civilization might create simulated universes as a form of amusement.</p>
	<p>Education or Training: The simulation could be designed as a learning environment for the inhabitants within it. The creators may be interested in observing how intelligent beings evolve, learn, and adapt within the simulated environment.</p>
	<p>Simulation Hypothesis: The simulated universe might be created to test or validate the hypothesis that a sufficiently advanced civilization could create realistic simulated realities.</p>
	<p>Escape or Preservation: The creators may have created the simulation as a means of escape or preservation. Perhaps their own reality faced existential threats, and they sought to create a simulated refuge or backup.</p>
	<p>Philosophical Exploration: The creation of a simulated reality could be part of a philosophical or existential exploration by the creators. It might be a way for them to explore questions about consciousness, reality, and the nature of existence.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these reasons are speculative and exist within the realm of philosophical and theoretical discussions. The actual motivations, if any, for creating a simulated universe remain unknown, and the simulation hypothesis is still a topic of debate and exploration rather than an established scientific theory.</p>

<p>ME<p>

<p>I have a mathematical theory that suggests life is a natural property of the universe. That star systems like ours are part of a natural process, so it can have life. Could it be that this theory of mine is part of the program for the simulation in simulation theory, and if so did I come up with theory or was I rendered by the program to formulate the theory?</p>
<p>Chat GPT</p>
<p>The concept you're describing aligns with the idea that life is a natural property of the universe and that certain conditions in star systems like ours lead to the emergence of life. In the context of simulation theory, the question you're asking ventures into the philosophical realm and raises questions about free will, consciousness, and the nature of ideas.</p>
<p>In a simulated reality, if one were to entertain the idea that the simulation includes the generation of theories or ideas, it introduces the notion that the individuals within the simulation, including yourself, might be part of the program. This idea draws parallels with the philosophical concept of determinism, where all events, including thoughts and actions, are predetermined by preceding events.</p>
<p>However, it's essential to emphasize that simulation theory is speculative and lacks empirical evidence. The questions about the origin of ideas, creativity, and consciousness are complex and not definitively answered by simulation theory or any other current scientific framework.</p>
<p>In reality, the development of theories and ideas is a complex interplay of biological, cognitive, environmental, and cultural factors. Even if we were in a simulated reality, the nature of creativity and the emergence of ideas might be designed within the simulation, or it could be a product of the complexity inherent in the simulated universe.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the discussion about whether your theory is part of the program or whether you came up with it involves philosophical considerations and remains open to interpretation. The current state of knowledge doesn't provide a concrete answer to these questions.</p>

<p>If the human mind is honest with itself it is not unreasonable for it to say that it perceives the Universe exists, and as well for it to say existence is impossible. Since these two contradict one another, one has to conclude that the human mind is inherently incapable of understanding reality, that something is very wrong. It may be that the brain, which creates the mind, is not evolved enough to understand reality.</p>

<p>Let us open this up, for there to be something it had to come from nothing uncaused, because every cause needs a cause, yet according to the human mind everything needs and cause, and and because of the this there once had to be nothing, but it is impossible to reason an uncaused cause. Since the mind cannot go beyond this, and there is a universe, the mind is not adequate to make sense.</p>

<p>But if there is a Universe, it may be that it is not what the mind perceives it to be. Reason is a tool for modeling reality and it helps us to survive, but does not tell us what reality is. Mathematics and physics is the ultimate method of reason. Let us look at how they do not tell us what reality is…</p>

<p>What is space and time? We don’t know, it is our starting point and is not described by anything. For instance what is velocity? It is the change in distance with time, meters per second (m/s). Let us write velocity:</p>

<p>Equation 1.    v=x/t</p>

<p>But what is the distance x? It is velocity over time, that is how we define it.  Let’s write that:</p>

<p>Equation 2.     x=vt</p>

<p>Let’s put our value of velocity into equation 2:</p>

<p>x=(x/t)t</p>

<p>We have t cancels with t leaving x=x meaning distance is distance, so we have not said anything about distance (spacial extension in one of the dimensions). We can in fact put all of the relationships between mass, length, and time in any equation in physics and it will return</p>

<p>mass=mass</p>

<p>distance=distance</p>

<p>time=time</p>

<p>So in the end we may have formally written out for instance an equation for gravity that will land us on the Moon, but the equation reduces to saying nothing about what reality actually is. We can theorize what space, mass, and time are, but in the end these theories will result in the same circles as above because they will just create new starting points that need to be explained. Reality is an infinite regress.</p>

<p>If we introduce a God to explain how reality got started from nothing, then we have the problem of how did god get started from nothing. The Universe is impossible, our own existence is impossible, the universe and our existence need causes and those causes need causes, and the causes of those causes need causes and so on in an infinite regress. If the universe, or God had always been there, uncaused for an eternity, that explains nothing because why is it the way it is, why had it always been such that matter has the property of protons that have the masses and sizes they do that make-up everything as opposed to another way, where the universe would fly apart, which it would do if these things were different than they were.</p>

<p>Thus we come to the French Mathematician Rene Descartes, he said “I think, therefore I am”. It seems to me I think, but I can’t explain what I am, that I can’t even explain how I could possibly be, how I could have something from nothing uncaused. Indeed psychiatry does not know what creates the mind because if you trace it back you end-up in paradox. The mind arises from chemistry and neurons firing. But what causes a neuron to fire? The atoms that make-up the neurons are described by quantum mechanics, but as its main founder NIels Bohr said of it, if you haven’t realized that everything that makes-up reality can’t be considered real, you have missed the whole point of quantum mechanics. This is where Einstein, unhappy with the indeterministic natural of reality put forward by quantum mechanics famously said “God doesn’t play dice with the universe”, because we never know when that neuron will fire, there is just a probability, but it can go in a another direction for no discernible reason, this is built into quantum mechanics with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle; we can’t measure reality at the quantum level without affecting the outcome of the experiment, that the observer cannot be separated from the observed. In other words, in looking at the brain and how it works, we look at the chemistry, and to describe the chemistry we have to look at the atoms, which is where we run in to quantum mechanics telling us none of it is real.</p>

<p>Thus if we can’t have an uncaused cause, yet have existence, God has to transcend this and we are left with God is not something the human mind can describe. I think this is why religions put him in terms of something we understand, even though this description does not resolve the paradox. We put him in a beard for wisdom, a staff for knowledge, a robe for universality, But as our existence is inconceivable, so must be the the Nature of God what ever such an entity might be. And why a male? The Torah, from which we get the Old Testament of the Bible originally held that God had a wife, her name was Ashara, but she was eventually written out of the the Torah, but there are a few sects in the world today that still include her. That may be a better symbology because creation is a product of the union of Man and Woman, and it seems she was eventually written out of the Torah as usual, due to politics, to put woman in a lower position to have her subservient. Why one God, why not something like a council, or board of trustees? God or no God, Gods or no Gods, the whole thing, reality, seems simultaneously present yet impossible.</p>

<p>It is difficult to detect planets around stars other than the Sun, because the planets are so small and only shine by reflected light and the stars are so bright that they easily wash them out. However we have done it allot with both the method of transit, and by detecting a wobble in the star from the planet tugging on it, by looking at small doppler shifts in the star due to its motion from the wobble. However, we want to detect Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of  yellow spectral class G stars like our Sun, and it is easiest with large gas giants like Jupiter further from the star and with enough size to make a noticeable drop in the light of the star due to a transit (due to the planet passing in front of the star). For Earth-sized planets we have detected the first, but around a cool, red dwarf spectral class M star. We find a lot of planets around M type stars and this is because they are smaller and fainter meaning a transit is more noticeable because a larger percent of the light is dimmed. As well because these stars are cooler, the habitable zone is closer in, and thus the orbital period is shorter, about a month compared to 365 days. For an orbit of 365 days we would have to measure the star’s brightness for 365 days, and do this about 3 times to verify there is an Earth-sized planet orbiting it. Red dwarf spectral class M stars are the most populous in our galaxy, and they might have life, but one could speculate the conditions would not be very good for complex intelligent life because the planets in their habitable zones are usually probably tidally locked because they are so close in to the star, that due to gravity from the star they end up with a day as long as their year meaning they always have one face to the star like with our moon orbiting the Earth. There would be one-side where it is always daytime and the other side where it is always night, meaning life would more than likely happen on the twilight zone where night meets day. We really want to find Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of yellow spectral class G stars like our Sun. This occurs where the planet is not too close in or too far out, so that the temperature is right for water to be liquid.</p>

<p>However, I have found a way of theorizing that habitable planets don’t just exist around yellow stars like our Sun, but that they are perhaps a natural property of the Universe. I do this by suggesting star systems mirror the atom and have a solution to the wave equation we use to model the atom. The result is that our solar system for which we have data, is a solution of the wave equation in terms of the protons that make it up. Since protons have the same properties throughout the Universe, I can propose that such habitable star systems may be a property of the Universe. The James Webb telescope is being prepared for the search for Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of yellow stars like the our Sun, it is even being prepared to try and photograph them (detect them directly) and to do spectroscopy on them to determine the compositions of their atmospheres. So I may have the data I need to see if my findings extend throughout the Universe, at least throughout our our galaxy.</p>

<p>A strange occurrence in my theory is that the equations are based around the duration of 1 second. I say strange because this means the second is a natural unit, but it was not designed as such. It came from ancient times, from the Sumerians who first settled down from hunting with stone spearpoints and invent agriculture, writing, mathematics, and government. We got the 60 minute hour and 60 second minute from them because they chose base 60 counting for their mathematics, probably because it is so evenly divisible by so much. This went to the Babylonians, and then to the Ancient Greeks, who first started cataloging the stars, and measuring the Earth day, lunar month, solar year, and motions of the planets that we use in the western tradition. It is a mystery in archaeology and anthropology, what caused the Sumerians to settle down from hunting with stone spearpoints and to begin smelting metal for tools, and firing clay to make homes, because on an anthropological time-scale it happened almost overnight, so there have been those who have suggested their knowledge was given to them by visitors from space.</p>

<p>The idea that life is part of a cosmic process is not new. The British astronomer Fred Hoyle suggested the idea that in the formation of stars and planets life was seeded throughout the Universe with a common seed in his Panspermia theory. To do this, since life as we know it is based on carbon he had to show how stars make carbon, which he is credited with having discovered in his triple-alpha process. Astrobiology, also called exobiology has been a science for some time now, which treats biology of not just the Earth but as a phenomenon throughout the universe. Now the subject has textbooks and is being included in some astronomy curriculum at universities. We are now a spacefaring civilization, and there is no reason to suggest there are not other spacefaring civilizations in the Universe. We may not be able to travel between the stars yet, but we can travel within our solar system, having sent robotic landers to Mars and having landed men on the Moon. Computers have advanced immensely since the 1950’s and there is no predicting what technological advances this will lead to soon. We might find now that we are going into space that there exists a political system in place among the spacefaring worlds of the stars that we will be asked to join. This subject has been the life work of Neil Freer, who thought we would soon be invited into stellar civilization, and who dealt with the subject of exopolitics.</p>

<p> Here I present my findings that the solar system mirrors atomic systems and has a quantum mechanical solution to the Schrödinger wave equation based on a base unit of 1 second. I further suggest that this solution for our spectral class G2V star the Sun, may indicate that life is a uniform cosmic unfolding throughout the Universe. In order to test whether this works for many G2V stars like our Sun we would need to detect Earth sized planets around other such stars, to see if my Planck constant works for other planetary systems, which I show is connected to my theory for the radius of a proton in terms the Natural constants such as the gravitational constant for gravity and the Planck constant for atoms. Though we measure time with the duration of a second and it came from no idea in Nature but rather how we divided up the day into units since ancient times, it turns out it is a natural duration in this theory and I suggest it is because of  how we divided up the day and year from observing the  apparent motions of the Sun and stars due to the Earth’s motion, that we may have inadvertently had an idea in this that was Natural in terms of the Nature pf atoms and the Earth/Moon/Sun system. Our theory also seems to based on a sixfold symmetry based around the skeletons of life chemistry, the hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>I further develop an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements and suggest an intermediary mass between that of the proton and the stars. This results in a constant k that is characteristic of the universe and is in inverse velocity. With these we show it may be that yellow G2V stars with a planet in the habitable zone may be a property of the Universe. I find that the Earth/Moon/Sun system gives the eigenvalue or basis vector for Natural Systems predicting the life span of the Universe in the standard cosmological model.</p>

<p>At the end of the paper we apply our theory to another star system, one that is the only one we have detected so far with an Earth-sized planet in it habitable zone. Unfortunately this star is not a yellow G2V star like our Sun, but a red dwarf M star. But we get a feeling for how to apply this theory.</p> 

<p>The central theme of this paper is that life may be a Natural property of the Universe.</p>

<p> Historically the hydrogen atom was modeled by Bohr with data of it from observation. Later the Schrödinger wave equation was solved for the hydrogen atom to obtain the same results. In our attempt here to model star systems as quantum mechanical systems we can do the same because we have observations of our solar system. The Schrödinger equation models the Bohr atom for a particle in a bounded sphere and here we are looking at planets not in a sphere but in a disc. Work has been done for the Schrödinger evolution of self gravitating discs. In fact it has been shown since the 1960’s that the Schrödinger equation follows from classical mechanics quite simply from the Hamiltonian formulation of Newton’s laws. But solving it is quite another matter for a disc of particles in a gravitational well. Really, for the hydrogen atom we only have one particle around a proton, and though this can be solved and explain Bohr and the periodic table, it can be impossible for atoms with more than one electron around a nucleus of several protons. However, in this paper we have found a Planck constant for the Earth/Moon/Sun system that solves it, so we would be wise to take Bohr’s shortcut at this point, considering the overwhelming complexity of billions of particles in a gravitating disc. This can be done because the Bohr model takes an electron around a proton as a circular orbit and that is what the Earth is around the Sun. It has be taken as an analogy, and not the same, because planetary systems are very different than atoms. For instance electrons can jump from one orbit to another and planets don’t. We find the Planck constant developed in Part 1 does solve a wave equation for the Earth/Moon/Sun system. </p>
<p>It is shown here that the Universe and life unfold in sixfold symmetry where the Earth-Moon-Sun system can be treated much the way quanta such as in the electron-proton system of the atom is treated, and that they are connected to one another. This is done by  introducing a Planck-type constant for the Earth-Moon-Sun system and relating it to that of quantum mechanics. The radius of a proton is predicted in agreement with experiment, and a constant k is developed that comes from an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements that we develop that is again sixfold in Nature. We find that the unit of a second is a natural base unit even though its historical development was not intended as such. With k we can predict the age of the Universe as given by the Friedmann model, the rotation period of the Earth (1 Day), and the Earth orbital period (1 year).  The Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars and the Van Der Waals radius for a hydrogen atom are used in this paper, their theories are in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 respectively. If the solar Planck constant is equal to that of quantum mechanics by a factor of the kinetic energy of the Earth, we are left asking if something like this works for our solar system does it work for other star systems. If it does, then we ask is life part of some cosmic process. We can only answer this when more refined data comes in for earth-like exoplanets around other stars, and the ability to detect moons around these exoplanets because the unit of a second involves the kinetic energy of the Earth’s moon as well. Further we are able to show that our equations yield number as form, which is to say we can put things in set theory to show that one is one object, and that object is a proton, one of the fundamental units for building everything.</p>

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We don’t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>
