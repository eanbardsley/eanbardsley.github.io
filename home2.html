<p>One of things I wanted to go into in this paper (The Mystery of the Moon and the Proton) but didn’t is that you can speak of the structure of the solar system even though it changes with time, thought that is evident from what is written at the beginning of section 10.0.</p>

<p>The whole object  of developing a theory for the way planetary systems form is that they meet the following criterion: They predict the Titius-Bode rule for the distribution of the planets; the distribution gives the planetary orbital periods from Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation. The distribution of the planets is chiefly predicted by three factors: The inward forces of gravity from the parent star, the outward pressure gradient from the stellar production of radiation, and the outward inertial forces as a cloud collapses into a flat disc around the central star. These forces separate the flat disc into rings, agglomerations of material, each ring from which a different planet forms at its central distance from the star (it has a thickness). In a theory of planetary formation from a primordial disc, it should predict the Titius-Bode rule for the distribution of planets. When I speak of the state of the solar system I speak of this point toward which the solar system has formed and not the small changes that happen over millions of years due to mutual interference between the bodies. In fact, mutual interference has torn apart possible forming planets resulting in the current distribution we have today, because the current distribution is more or less stable. The asteroid belt is a good example of this — it is a location where a planet cannot form due to harmonic (repetitive) action on the orbital period at its distance by orbital periods of planets beyond it. In short we take the state of the solar system as an inflection point between what it became, and what it might minutely be going away from in billions of years after it dies and can no longer support life.</p>

<p>We describe reality as being based in the six-fold. I really think Nature employs 6-fold symmetry because I think it is the most dynamic being the product of the two smallest prime numbers 2 and 3. Those are the smallest factors down to which anything can be reduced, so that is why I think 6-fold is the basis of Nature, that the basis has to be reduced to the smallest factors. As such we have 2x3=6, 3x3=9, 2x9=18 and 3x6=18. The periodic table of elements is periodic over 18 groups, which means when you count to 18 the elements start over making groups where they have similar properties falling into the same groups. These groups are determined by electron configurations, for instance carbon is in group 4 which means since it wants to have noble gas electron configuration, it gains 4 electrons to be the same as the noble gas in group 18 of the same period. 18-14=4 meaning it ionizes as C4- so it has 4 electrons to combine with 4 hydrogen atoms that are each H+ or so we can have two H atoms that can combine with one oxygen atom which is O2- because oxygen is in group 16 meaning 18-16=2, and so forth making life possible.<p>
<p>From here we can determine a theoretical value for the radius of the proton that falls within experimental errors. We propose defining inertia as proton-seconds, the action of subatomic particles like the proton over time. We see this is based around biological life, hydrogen and carbon which makes the hydrocarbons, the skeletons of organic matter. We develop a constant k that bridges the microcosmos, like the elements and their constituents, with the macrocosmos, like the earth-moon system. We find that though the unit of a second was developed by the way we constructed our calendar, it actually is a Natural Unit in the SI system of units, as incredible as that may seem. It describes both the moon’s orbit and the proton for which we find their is a mystery which this paper mainly addresses. We find the magnetic field generated by the Sun displays the same six-fold symmetry we are finding at the basis of reality and that is defined by biological life. We propose the solar magnetic field may play a role in the outcome of life; we know the DNA molecule spirals preferentially in one direction over another and scientists have hypothesized it may be from a net circular polarization in one direction of light from the Sun that is caused by magnetic fields in sunspot activity. Though as well this may come from cosmic ray net circular polarizations that have been guiding the evolution of life on Earth.</p>
<p>
To develop our constant k, we have to formulate an intermediary mass characteristic of Universe between the proton and the stars in scale. This is done by using the Chandrasekhar limit for the mass of of a star to not collapse into a blackhole, but to be able to counter its gravitational force with pressure from electron degeneracy alone.We find we can also determine the proton charge with our constant k that determines the proton-radius. </p>

<p>
Here I hypothesize an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements from Avogadro’s number, and determine from that a constant k based on the idea that there is a constant for the intermediary scale between protons and stars using the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarf stars. After constructing a six-fold theory for inertia, or mass, based on the idea that a proton is a three dimensional cross-section of four dimensional hypersphere, I successfully predict the radius of a proton. In the course of this we find the second is a Natural unit of time both in terms of the proton, and gravitational constant G and Planck’s constant h, and in terms of the Earth/ Moon orbital mechanics. I show Avogadro’s number is a natural unit as well, both for the proton and atom, the equation of state, or constant k, and for the macroscale of Moon/Earth/Sun. We also see that this is a consequence of six-fold symmetry based on carbon the core element of life, and hydrocarbons, the skeleton’s or biological life chemistry. We find as well we can determine the charge of a proton with our constant k in terms of the six-fold, as well as the function of the solar magnetic field at Earth orbit.</p>

<p>Here in this version of the paper we revisit the proton and go into an explanation of the Van Der Waal Radius from which our equation for the radius of a proton was derived. We also explain how the Chandrasekhar limit was derived, but don’t derive it and leave that to the textbooks in Astrophysics that all derive it in their chapters on stellar dynamics. The Chandrasekhar limit is used here for the derivation of our intermediate mass, our constant k, which determines our derivation of the unit of a second of time, and the charge of a proton, as well as the radius of a proton. We find in this second look at the proton we can hone our equation for the radius of a proton for more accuracy and what might be a more dynamic expression than the original equation. We then look at the geometry that follows from it.</p>

<p>It is my feeling if you want to reduce reality to its basis it should be in six-fold geometry. Indeed the periodic table seems to be this: the two smallest primes are 2 and 3, and their product is 6. We say 3 squared is 9 and two times 9 is 18 and 18 is 3 times 6. The periodic table is periodic over 18 groups. Here I present my findings of the radius of the proton predicted in terms of this six-fold structure through the skeletons of biological life, the hydrocarbons. To do this I have to show that the second is a natural unit of time, and indeed I do in terms of two different aspects of Universal structure, the planets (in particular the Moon-Earth-Sun system) which is on the macroscale and in terms of the elements, atoms and their Natural constants including both the Planck constant, and the Universal constant of Gravitation. As such this is explaining what Quantum Field Theory strives to explain, gravity of celestial bodies, and electric forces of the atoms in terms of a single theory. To do this I have to introduce a constant k which utilizes Avogadro’s number as a Natural number. I find it can be considered this, that it is not arbitrary, but comes from an equation of state for the periodic table of the elements. I further find electric charges can be explained in terms of six-fold symmetry and that even the Sun’s magnetic field does the same and that this is all perhaps centered around allowing for biological life. I even find the same is true for the rotation of the Earth.<p>

I believe the reason for my finds of six-fold symmetry in both the radius of a proton and it its charge can be explained by Buckminster Fuller’s vector equilibrium. It is the most transformable straight-line geometry if you attach sticks with flexible corners, what Fuller calls a flex corner. Which means it zero-frequency for omni directional closest packing of spheres is 12 spheres, which is carbon (six protons and six neutrons) which is the basis of life as we know it. Its diameter is then six proton radii which we found provided for by the solar magnetic field. <p>

Here I show that the physical characteristics of the Universe can be described by the six-fold unfolding of space and time in relatively simple terms, namely the characteristics inertia, proton radius, proton charge, and the Sun’s magnetic field. Further that to do this we need to formulate a constant that bridges the macrocosmos to the microcosmos, that is the planets to the proton and the elements. Interestingly, their seems to be correspondence of this with the Old Testament, which is discussed in terms of the cause being perhaps in the Universality of the six- fold. The six-fold theory of reality results in a cosmic calendar, and it is correlated the Earth’s past extinction events. It predict we could be in one now plus or minus 20 million years. However many scientists believe we are in one now (Called the Anthropocene) where human impact on the Earth is changing it drastically, mostly due to burning fossil fuels and putting CO2 into the atmosphere in excess of 350 parts per million, which causes global warming. We can change that future, however, by switching to cleaner, renewable energy sources. We just have to choose it.
