<p> It is reported here that planetary and atomic scales (the proton) may be described by a characteristic time of about 1 second, where the second we have today comes from the ancient Sumerians having divided the Earth rotation period into 24 units (hours) and their base 60 counting system that ultimately resulted in dividing the hour into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds. We find the ground state of the our solar system is based on the mass of the Moon, and that the algebraic condition for the Moon nearly perfectly eclipsing the Sun may be a condition for optimal habitability of earth-like planets in habitable zones in general. It is found from a relationship in Vedic yoga that an equation exists for the radius of the habitable planet that produces a planetary radius for all spectral-types of stars about that of the Earth. It is suggested that perhaps this size, owing to its gravity, might be ideal for life chemistry to take place based on elemental properties. It is found that our characteristic time of one second, yielding the proton radius closely, and describing our Solar System, may have been inherited from the Big Bang, and that the the protoplanetary disc that gave rise to the the planets may have inherited this characteristic time from the Big Bang as well. We find the characteristic time of one second follows from not just the Sumerian quantization of time into (24, 60) for the earth rotation but that this works with the radius and mass of the Earth, which results in a quantization of angular momentum for the Solar System.. We also find that 1 second encodes for the core element of life, carbon. In short, we can encode everything in the Universe from the Big Bang, to the proton, to the protoplanetary disc, to the Solar System, to life with one unit, a second of time.</p>

<p>The rudiments for a theory of planetary and atomic systems bridging macro-scales (planetary systems) with micro-scales (the atomâ€™s proton) is achieved through a wave equation solution of our Solar System that is used to describe atoms in quantum mechanics. We find the base unit of time, the characteristic time, in the solution for our Solar System and the atom comes out to be the base unit of time developed since ancient times by the ancient Sumerians and Babylonians of one second. Applying this theory to multiple star systems reveals that the optimal conditions for life may be intersecting at Earth-like star systems. It is suggested that stars that host planets that are good hosts for intelligent life to develop begins at around spectral class F stars to spectral class K stars on the main sequence with the optimal conditions intersecting between these two around spectral class G stars in the area of our star, the Sun. Moons of planets are shown to play a key role in the wave solution for the star systems and turn out to define their ground state if they are habitable. Our moon plays a primary role in allowing for life on the Earth, stabilizing its orbit allowing for the seasons. It may be the conditions for complex life maximize during the epoch where a moon perfectly eclipses the star it orbits as seen from the habitable planet which determines some forms of the equations that give the characteristic time of the star system at or around 1 second. The characteristic time of 1 second common to the Solar System and atomic systems appears to be characteristic, as well, of hydrocarbons the skeletons of life chemistry in a context of sixfold symmetry. An in depth look at the moon eclipsing the Sun as seen from the Earth over geologic times is given. In section 12.0 and 13.0 we present the ideal method for modeling habitable star systems with our theory. There is not one kind of planet for any particular orbit that is the only one possible; you can have many kinds of planets form for a given type of star. We conclude that the intersection of an atomic and planetary science happens with habitable systems like the one that belongs to our Sun, a so-called G2V star system and within a range from F to K stars, the G stars being of the type that includes our Sun, which is in-between the two. This seems to happen in a star system where there are perfect eclipses of the star by the moon, as occurs in our Solar System. We successfully model from F8V stars to G8V stars with a computer program applying the ideal method. We find the so called PlanetDay characteristic time intersects with the characteristic time around the G0V stars, and that all three characteristic times, that is including that of the proton, come closest to intersecting at around stars like our Sun, G2V. We also look at the origins of the second from the ancient Sumerians and see that it may be the idea behind its development has something to do with it being the characteristic times in star systems and atoms.</p>

<p>My theory has something to do with why we would be going into space, which indicates it might be in part to find out if other star systems have dynamic relationships with protons that make up atoms and both those with time as measured in their calendars by dynamic mathematical relationships that may exist in the motions of their planets and their moons as is the case with our star system, The Solar System. My theory shows we have this with our star system, and would suggest we need to find other star systems with habitable planets to see if they have them and relate them to ours if they do so as to reveal a higher truth as to how and why we are here, and what our purpose might be.</p>

UFOs in 1952 hovered over the capitol for two weekends, fighter jets were scrambled. Washington is at the same 37 parallel that I found connected to UFO activity and is the path of the star vega (See above paper). I just learned about this and it turns out since then the US has built its important facilities on that latitude, including Area 51.

<p>Do The Moonmakers Exist And Is The Moon Important?</p>

The Moon as seen from the Earth about perfectly eclipses the Sun

<p>There is a great mystery surrounding our moon, it has a very low density, meaning it has a low mass for its size, and it is considered very large and massive for the Moon of a terrestrial planet like the Earth, which is more typical of a moon orbiting a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn.</p>

<p>Because of the strange mass of the Moon and its unusual occurrence around a planet like the Earth, and its unusually nearly perfect circular orbit, it has been suggested by some scientists to be hollow, even a hollow spacecraft, put there to help life by holding the Earth at its tilt to its orbit. When we went to the Moon, NASA dropped the launch stage for the lander on the Moon, and they measured the seismic activity. It rang for an hour like a bell, as if it were hollow. The Earth doesnâ€™t do this, some say because of all the water on its surface dampening it, others say only something hollow could ring like that.</p>

<p>This makes me think of a science fiction short story be Arthur C. Clarke, The Sentinel, which was the precursor to the movie 2001. It had in the first mission to the Moon, two astronauts finding a glistening object atop a mountain on the Moon. They climbed up to it and broke the protection barrier surrounding the sentinel, which was a large monolith monitoring Earth. They said call Earth and tell them to expect visitors. They realized in breaking the seal, it would stop communication of the sentinel with its makers, making them aware that we figured out how to get from Earth to the Moon.</p>

<p>In 2001 the movie large monoliths were put on the Earth and the Moon to monitor human progress. The monolith makers seeded the Universe with life and put monoliths on the planets to monitor the progress of life and to give it evolutionary nudges when needed. Perhaps the Moonmakers, if they exist, if our Moon is really a hollow spacecraft holding the Earth at its tilt to its orbit to make life possible, perhaps they put it there because we are supposed to figure that out, go there, enter the craft and move the Moon when needed to be in an orbit that counters the factors that are not beneficial to life that are underway. Perhaps the Moon is something that can be moved to adjust the climate of the Earth.</p>

<p>The Moon at its inclination to the Earth in its orbit makes life possible here because it holds the Earth at its tilt to its orbit around the Sun allowing for the seasons so the Earth doesnâ€™t get too extremely hot or too extremely cold. We see the Moon may be there for a reason.</p>

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We donâ€™t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>
