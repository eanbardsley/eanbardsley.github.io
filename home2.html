<p>This paper describes planetary systems, atomic systems, and biological systems under one idea, as such it is kind of a theory of everything.</p>

<p>In Part 1 of this paper I show that the system of measuring time we have today, that divides the day into 24 hours and the hours into 60 minutes, and the minutes into 60 seconds, that came to us from the ancient Sumerians, who divided the day into 24 hours, and who gave us the base 60 counting that resulted in our base unit of time, the second, to have the duration it has today, was a choice that happens to coincide with my theory that shows that our Earth/Moon/Sun system and atomic systems have a solution in common of the Schrödinger wave equation with the same base unit of time of 1 second.</p>

<p>The ancient Sumerians were the first to settle down from wandering, following the herds and hunting them with stone spearpoint to invent agriculture, architecture, mathematics, astronomy, and writing. They gave us civilization as we know it today. Since their second came to us from their system of counting and I have found the second to be a base unit and natural constant for our planetary system and atomic systems in common, I think it is reasonable to suggest that perhaps they were given their system of mathematics by ancient Aliens. This is easy to suggest because their writings say they were given their knowledge by “Those who came from above.”</p>

<p>Part 2 I have a theory for the star systems, the planets and their suns, wherein such systems are solved with the Schrödinger wave equation that is used to solve atomic systems. The result is that star systems and atomic systems, systems on the macroscales and microscales, are governed by the same underlying principles. It came to pass that this theory indicated an overlap with biological systems indicating that biological life could be part of the same idea. Here I develop that.</p>

<p>Part 3 Our solution of the wave equation for the planets gives the kinetic energy of the Earth from the mass of the Moon orbiting the Earth, but you could formulate based on the Earth orbiting the Sun. This yields one second as a base unit as well.</p>

<p>Part 4 We want to find what the wave equation solutions are for Jupiter and Saturn because they significantly carry the majority of the mass of the solar system and thus should embody most clearly the dynamics of the wave solution to the Solar System.</p>

<p>The main job of finding a theory of everything (TOE) is to make the pieces fit together. That is the primary task, which can be achieved in an abstract sense, leaving the results open to interpretation. We often see theories are reformulated, but many of the equations are the same, and this may be because the equations are from measurables, but since mathematics is self-referential, abstract, and an approximation to reality because of its assumptions which result in conundrums, we are left with reality ending in paradox. It may be reality is an infinite regress, so making the pieces fit together suffices, and the interpretations can be left to the state of knowledge at the time, which is always changing.</p>

<p>Here I formulate spacetime operators that solve the atom and Earth/Moon/Sun System in common. It may be that they solve more than that, but that is where I have applied them here. It may be many more operators are needed for solutions of everything. The operators are in kilograms/meters/seconds because space and time (meters and seconds) define matter (kilograms) and everything, or most everything, seems to be a relationship between mass, space, and time.</p>

<p>I find the base unit of Nature is 1 second in duration, which is interesting, if not strange, because the second came from a base 60 sexagesimal system of counting handed to us by the ancient Sumerians who started civilization some 12,000 years ago, long before knowledge of the atom and wave equations. I find I can solve the Earth/Moon/Sun system with the Schrödinger wave equation used for proton/electron systems comprising the atom, and that the quantization is done in terms of the Moon, which seems to be some sort of a Natural Yardstick.</p>

<p>In order to solve the electron in these terms I have to introduce the concept of intermediate mass and intermediate velocity. The result is we go from the particles that make atoms, to the atoms, which are the elements, then to the planets and the Sun, for a journey from the microscale to the macroscale where everything unfolds as one.</p>

<p> At the end of the paper, section 11.0, we see  the Cambrian explosion of life that lead to the more complex and diverse varieties of life we have to today might have had something to do with the Moon having the right orbital velocity for the optimization of life.</p>

<p>
The Moon, of the Earth, has long been thought of as not making sense, it is large and massive for a moon of a terrestrial planet while it has a very low density, low mass for its size, when it should be comparable to that of the Earth. When we dropped the launch pods from lunar craft for the Apollo mission on the Moon and measured the seismic activity, it seemed to ring like a bell for an hour, something characteristic of something hollow. Further studies were done by NASA after that in a classified study called Chapel Bell, which remains classified 50 years after we went to the Moon. It has been suggested by some scientists that the Moon would make more sense if it was hollow, and even that it was a hollow spacecraft put there for the purpose of making life more successful on Earth. If it was a craft, and we could enter it and move it to adjust our climate when it is going awry not only from global warming but due to periodic ice ages caused by small cyclical changes in the Earth orbit, that would solve a lot.</p>

<p> Included in this study is modeling not just the Earth/Moon/Sun system but habitable star systems in general in terms of them having an enigmatic moon like we have. While it may not be mainstream science to suggest the Moon of the the Earth is hollow, it is a part of it to suggest that very successful habitable planets would need to have an enigmatic moon like we do. I even find that our description of the atom’s proton in terms of a base unit of one second from which we derive the Earth’s moon, that the equation is based around hydrocarbons, the skeletons of life chemistry.</p>

<p>My astronomical discoveries "The Earth A Habitable Planet As A Solution To The Wave Equation" have lead me to suggest perhaps something we could call "the Moonmakers", this video here about the Earth being planned may have something to do with it:</p>

<p>****************************************************************************************</p>

<p>Do The Moonmakers Exist And Is The Moon Important?</p>

My paper “The Earth A Habitable Planet As A Solution To The Wave Equation” solves our planetary system with the Schrödinger wave equation. It may even solve what it means to have habitable star systems in general and leads me to consider the possible existence of what we could call “The Moonmakers”.</p>

<p>If the Earth Day gets longer, it will have less cooling and get warmer. If the Moon’s orbit gets larger it may be it will less effectively hold the Earth’s tilt to the Sun, and we could lose the seasons and end up with temperature extremes bad for life. It may be that a condition for complex intelligent life on Earth is:</p>

<p>r_planet/r_moon = R_star/R_moon</p>

<p>The more immediate problem before us is catastrophic climate change (global warming). Since the industrial revolution we have greatly increased the amount of the heat retaining gas CO2 in the atmosphere. Parts per billion have gone up from about 200 to 400. Trees make some of this and some of it is necessary, or the Earth would get to cool, but too much, the tipping point is considered 350, and the Earth will warm beyond what is necessary for life to be as successful as it has been. A less immediate problem is the Sun is warming by very small amounts over time. In 2 billion years it would warm to the point that it would boil away the oceans. A star with the mass of our Sun will stay on the main sequence for 10 billion years, after which it will deplete its fuel and and expand beyond Earth orbit and start burning the by-products of its earlier fuel. This should happen in about 5 billion years, at which point it would seem Mars, further away from the Sun than the Earth, might become the habitable planet. A star with half the mass of our Sun, a red dwarf, can last 80 to 100 billion years on the main sequence, longer than the current age of the Universe 13.8 billion years. We have found an Earth sized planet in the habitable zone of such a star, the TOI 700 system, and we expect to find a lot more. Red dwarf stars are the most populous in our galaxy. However, because they are cooler, the habitable zone is closer in, meaning the planets are probably tidally locked with the stars they orbit, meaning their days are the same as their year, just as the day of our moon is the same as its month, these bodies always having the same face toward what they orbit. Thus for a habitable planet around a red dwarf, one side is always extremely hot and the other extremely cold. The habitable region of such a planet would be where night meets day on its surface, the twilight zone.</p>

<p>There is a great mystery surrounding our moon, it has a very low density, meaning it has a low mass for its size, and it is considered very large and massive for the Moon of a terrestrial planet like the Earth, which is more typical of a moon orbiting a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn.</p>

<p>Because of the strange mass of the Moon and its unusual occurrence around a planet like the Earth, and its unusually nearly perfect circular orbit, it has been suggested by some scientists to be hollow, even a hollow spacecraft, put there to help life by holding the Earth at its tilt to its orbit. When we went to the Moon, NASA dropped the launch stage for the lander on the Moon, and they measured the seismic activity. It rang for an hour like a bell, as if it were hollow. The Earth doesn’t do this, some say because of all the water on its surface dampening it, others say only something hollow could ring like that.</p>

<p>This makes me think of a science fiction short story be Arthur C. Clarke, The Sentinel, which was the precursor to the movie 2001. It had in the first mission to the Moon, two astronauts finding a glistening object atop a mountain on the Moon. They climbed up to it and broke the protection barrier surrounding the sentinel, which was a large monolith monitoring Earth. They said call Earth and tell them to expect visitors. They realized in breaking the seal, it would stop communication of the sentinel with its makers, making them aware that we figured out how to get from Earth to the Moon.</p>

<p>In 2001 the movie large monoliths were put on the Earth and the Moon to monitor human progress. The monolith makers seeded the Universe with life and put monoliths on the planets to monitor the progress of life and to give it evolutionary nudges when needed. Perhaps the Moonmakers, if they exist, if our Moon is really a hollow spacecraft holding the Earth at its tilt to its orbit to make life possible, perhaps they put it there because we are supposed to figure that out, go there, enter the craft and move the Moon when needed to be in an orbit that counters the factors that are not beneficial to life that are underway. Perhaps the Moon is something that can be moved to adjust the climate of the Earth.</p>

<p>Our equation in this paper for the Earth orbit does not depend on the Moon’s distance from the Earth, only its mass. The Moon slows the Earth rotation and this in turn expands the Moon’s orbit, so it is getting larger, the Earth loses energy to the Moon. The Earth day gets longer by 0.0067 hours per million years, and the Moon’s orbit gets 3.78 cm larger per year.</p> 

<p>Our wave equation solution may only use the Moon’s mass but the equation for kinetic energy of the Moon to kinetic energy of the Earth times the Earth Day equal to about one second:</p>

<p>(KE_moon/KE_earth)(EarthDay)=1.08 seconds</p>

<p>which we connect with the equation where the proton gives one second:</p>

<p>Equation In Proton Radius and Proton mass gives one second.</p>

<p>This holds for when the Moon was at a distance from the Earth such that it appears the same size as the Sun, which means:</p>

<p>r_planet/r_moon = R_star/R_moon</p>

Which is when the two equations above for one second connect to our wave equation solution to the Earth.

<p>KE_planet=(sqrt(n))(R_star/R_moon)(G,M_planet,M_moon,h_star)</p>

<p>The Moon at its inclination to the Earth in its orbit makes life possible here because it holds the Earth at its tilt to its orbit around the Sun allowing for the seasons so the Earth doesn’t get too extremely hot or too extremely cold. We see the Moon may be there for a reason.</p>

<p>Me</p>

<p>Is the observer rendered in simulation theory</p>
<p>Chat GPT</p>
<p>In simulation theory, the idea is that our reality, including ourselves as observers, could be a simulated or artificial construct. The question of whether the observer is "rendered" in simulation theory involves the concept that our consciousness, thoughts, and perceptions could be part of the simulation.</p>
<p>Simulation theory posits that an advanced civilization, possibly far in the future, has created a computer simulation that accurately replicates a reality similar to ours. Within this simulated reality, everything, including the observer (you and me), would be part of the simulated construct.</p>
<p>The nature of consciousness and the observer in simulation theory is a topic of philosophical and scientific debate. Some proponents argue that consciousness itself may be simulated, while others suggest that consciousness is fundamental and cannot be replicated within a simulation. Ultimately, it's a speculative idea without empirical evidence at this point, and various interpretations and hypotheses exist within the context of simulation theory.</p>

<p>ME</p>

<p>are we outside interacting with the simulation</p>

<p>Chat GPT</p>

<p>In the context of simulation theory, the idea that we are "outside" interacting with the simulation refers to the notion that there might be a higher or external reality beyond the simulated construct in which we exist. This higher reality could be inhabited by beings or entities that have created or are overseeing the simulation.</p>
<p>In this scenario, our consciousness and experiences within the simulated world would be part of the simulation, and the entities outside the simulation might have control or influence over the simulated environment. This idea is often associated with the concept of a simulation hypothesis, which suggests that our perceived reality is a computer-generated simulation created by a more advanced civilization.</p>
<p>It's important to note that simulation theory is speculative and lacks empirical evidence. While it can be a fascinating topic for philosophical and theoretical discussions, it is not currently supported by scientific consensus, and alternative explanations for the nature of reality exist.</p>

<p>ME</p>

<p>In simulation theory where to we, the observers, come from</p>

<p>Chat GPT</p>

<p>In simulation theory, the origin of the observers (us) is often attributed to the external reality or the higher-level civilization that supposedly created the simulation. According to this speculative hypothesis, the beings or entities in the external reality are responsible for generating the simulated universe, including its inhabitants and observers.</p>
<p>In this framework, the consciousness, experiences, and perceptions of individuals within the simulation are considered part of the simulated construct. The observers themselves, in this scenario, would not have an independent existence outside the simulation but would be entities within the simulated world.</p>
<p>It's important to emphasize that simulation theory is a speculative concept and currently lacks empirical evidence. The idea raises various philosophical and existential questions, and it is not universally accepted within the scientific community. Different interpretations and variations of simulation theory exist, and the discussion often revolves around the nature of consciousness, reality, and the potential capabilities of a hypothetical advanced civilization creating such a simulation.</p>

<p>ME</p>

<p>what is the reason for a higher intelligence or civilization to create the simulation</p>

<p>Chat GPT</p>

<p>The reasons that might be attributed to a higher intelligence or civilization creating a simulated reality are largely speculative, as simulation theory itself is a concept that currently lacks empirical evidence. However, proponents of simulation theory and related hypotheses have proposed several speculative reasons for why a more advanced civilization might create a simulated universe. Some of these hypothetical motivations include:</p>
	<p>Research or Experimentation: The creators of the simulation could be conducting a scientific experiment or research to better understand their own reality or to explore the consequences of different physical laws, scenarios, or evolutionary processes.</p>
	<p>Entertainment: The simulation might serve as a form of entertainment for the creators. Much like how we create virtual worlds and simulations for entertainment purposes, a more advanced civilization might create simulated universes as a form of amusement.</p>
	<p>Education or Training: The simulation could be designed as a learning environment for the inhabitants within it. The creators may be interested in observing how intelligent beings evolve, learn, and adapt within the simulated environment.</p>
	<p>Simulation Hypothesis: The simulated universe might be created to test or validate the hypothesis that a sufficiently advanced civilization could create realistic simulated realities.</p>
	<p>Escape or Preservation: The creators may have created the simulation as a means of escape or preservation. Perhaps their own reality faced existential threats, and they sought to create a simulated refuge or backup.</p>
	<p>Philosophical Exploration: The creation of a simulated reality could be part of a philosophical or existential exploration by the creators. It might be a way for them to explore questions about consciousness, reality, and the nature of existence.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these reasons are speculative and exist within the realm of philosophical and theoretical discussions. The actual motivations, if any, for creating a simulated universe remain unknown, and the simulation hypothesis is still a topic of debate and exploration rather than an established scientific theory.</p>

<p>ME<p>

<p>I have a mathematical theory that suggests life is a natural property of the universe. That star systems like ours are part of a natural process, so it can have life. Could it be that this theory of mine is part of the program for the simulation in simulation theory, and if so did I come up with theory or was I rendered by the program to formulate the theory?</p>
<p>Chat GPT</p>
<p>The concept you're describing aligns with the idea that life is a natural property of the universe and that certain conditions in star systems like ours lead to the emergence of life. In the context of simulation theory, the question you're asking ventures into the philosophical realm and raises questions about free will, consciousness, and the nature of ideas.</p>
<p>In a simulated reality, if one were to entertain the idea that the simulation includes the generation of theories or ideas, it introduces the notion that the individuals within the simulation, including yourself, might be part of the program. This idea draws parallels with the philosophical concept of determinism, where all events, including thoughts and actions, are predetermined by preceding events.</p>
<p>However, it's essential to emphasize that simulation theory is speculative and lacks empirical evidence. The questions about the origin of ideas, creativity, and consciousness are complex and not definitively answered by simulation theory or any other current scientific framework.</p>
<p>In reality, the development of theories and ideas is a complex interplay of biological, cognitive, environmental, and cultural factors. Even if we were in a simulated reality, the nature of creativity and the emergence of ideas might be designed within the simulation, or it could be a product of the complexity inherent in the simulated universe.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the discussion about whether your theory is part of the program or whether you came up with it involves philosophical considerations and remains open to interpretation. The current state of knowledge doesn't provide a concrete answer to these questions.</p>

<p>***********************************************************************************************</p>

<p>Does A Prebiotic Path To Life On Earth Exist</p>

<p>I have waded through the literature and the limiting factor is phosphate compounds.</p>

<p> In order to have life you need the 20 genetically encoded amino acids. DNA and RNA synthesize these into the proteins life needs. Miller and Urey simulated a hypothetical early Earth with the constituents water, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen mixing them together in a bottle and passing a current. They produced 11 of the genetically encoded amino acids, but not all of them.</p>

<p> Life also needs DNA and RNA. To have this you need the sugar ribose, phosphates, and the nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. Prebiotic paths, paths before life existed, to these nucleobases, exist, but they have to combine with ribose to make nucleosides, and these have to combine with phosphates to make nucleotides. There exist prebiotic paths to nucleotides, but they have to polymerize into long chains and the reactions required to do this use phosphate compounds that we know did not exist on early Earth. This is the main problem in trying to explain life on Earth. Phosphates are rare on Earth, life needs them for nutrients, and they are the limiting factor in Earth ecosystems that determine life density.</p>

<p>One could suggest life arose on planets that were rich in phosphates, evolved into intelligence, and polymerized nucleotides in a laboratory and put them on Earth.</p>

<p> The problem also that arises though, is the sequencing of the nucleobases into a complex set of instructions for synthesizing amino acids into the proteins life needs. We don’t know how such a set of instructions, the genetic code, could evolve into existence.</p>

<p> Further problems arise in the fats, or lipids; they make up a big part of the cells that make make up life that house the DNA and RNA.</p>
