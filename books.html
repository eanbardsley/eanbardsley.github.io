<p>The rudiments for a theory of planetary and atomic systems bridging macro-scales (planetary systems) with micro-scales (the atomâ€™s proton) is achieved through a wave equation solution of our Solar System that is used to describe atoms in quantum mechanics. We find the base unit of time, the characteristic time, in the solution for our Solar System and the atom comes out to be the base unit of time developed since ancient times by the ancient Sumerians and Babylonians of one second. Applying this theory to multiple star systems reveals that the optimal conditions for life may be intersecting at Earth-like star systems. It is suggested that stars that host planets that are good hosts for intelligent life to develop begins at around spectral class F stars to spectral class K stars on the main sequence with the optimal conditions intersecting between these two around spectral class G stars in the area of our star, the Sun. Moons of planets are shown to play a key role in the wave solution for the star systems and turn out to define their ground state if they are habitable. Our moon plays a primary role in allowing for life on the Earth, stabilizing its orbit allowing for the seasons. It may be the conditions for complex life maximize during the epoch where a moon perfectly eclipses the star it orbits as seen from the habitable planet which determines some forms of the equations that give the characteristic time of the star system at or around 1 second. The characteristic time of 1 second common to the Solar System and atomic systems appears to be characteristic, as well, of hydrocarbons the skeletons of life chemistry in a context of sixfold symmetry. An in depth look at the moon eclipsing the Sun as seen from the Earth over geologic times is given. In section 12.0 and 13.0 we present the ideal method for modeling habitable star systems with our theory. There is not one kind of planet for any particular orbit that is the only one possible; you can have many kinds of planets form for a given type of star. We conclude that the intersection of an atomic and planetary science happens with habitable systems like the one that belongs to our Sun, a so-called G2V star system and within a range from F to K stars, the G stars being of the type that includes our Sun, which is in-between the two. This seems to happen in a star system where there are perfect eclipses of the star by the moon, as occurs in our Solar System. We successfully model from F8V stars to G8V stars with a computer program applying the ideal method. We find the so called PlanetDay characteristic time intersects with the characteristic time around the G0V stars, and that all three characteristic times, that is including that of the proton, come closest to intersecting at around stars like our Sun, G2V. We also look at the origins of the second from the ancient Sumerians and see that it may be the idea behind its development has something to do with it being the characteristic times in star systems and atoms.</p>
