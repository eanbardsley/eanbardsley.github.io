<h1>The Search For The Galactic Codex</h1>

<p>I have found that our Solar System has a fascinating mathematical structure underlying it. Our planet is an extraordinary example of a life bearing world. The mathematical structure I have found in my wave solution of the Solar system for the Earth/Moon/System could be taken as characteristic of a star like our Sun. Naturally, in discovering something about our solar system we would wonder if other star systems have a dynamic mathematical construction as well. As such, we would want to go to other star systems and survey their characteristics, and any ancient history of how other civilizations measured time and made calendars based on their observations of celestial motions like we did with ours. We might guess that other civilizations in the universe might discover such incredible mathematical structure underlying their planetary systems as well and would, once they could achieve interstellar travel, begin a survey of the mathematical structure behind star systems of other life bearing worlds and create a collection of them done throughout the galaxy, and they may have worked with other civilizations throughout the galaxy and compiled, if you will, a Galactic Codex. Some may even have achieved intergalactic travel and found the thumbprints not just characteristic of star-types but of galaxy-types. Let us look at what I have found our first entries could be in a galactic codex, which would be for the star system we know best, our Solar System. We begin with the characteristic time for our solution is one second and is given by the mass of the moon, \(M_m\), cubed:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\hbar_{\odot}^2}{GM_m^3}\cdot\frac{1}{c}=1\text{ second}$$</p>

<p>Yes, it does happen to be one second, our base unit of time we have today, ultimately given to us by the ancient Sumerians when they invented mathematics thousands of years ago. This becomes important, as we will see. The other extraordinary thing we find is that the Planck-type constant for our solar system is given by the kinetic energy of the Earth, the third planet where life is extraordinarily abundant, multiplied by one second.</p>

<p>$$\hbar_\odot=(1\text{ second})KE_e$$</p>

<p>We find life occurs so successfully when the Earth day is about what it is today (24 hours long) giving a characteristic time of close to one second in terms of the kinetic energy of the Moon and the Earth:</p>

<p>$$\frac{KE_m}{KE_e}(\text{EarthDay})= 1.1 - 1.3 \text{ seconds}$$</p>

<p>I also find that this characteristic time of one second is characteristic of the proton, the most fundamental unit that makes up matter, predicting its radius:</p>

<p>$$\left(\frac{1}{6\alpha^2}\sqrt{\frac{4\pi h}{Gc}}\right)\cdot\frac{r_p}{m_p}=1\text{ second}$$</p>

<p>$$\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{\pi r_p}{\alpha^4Gm_p^3}}\right)\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{h}{c}=1\text{ second}$$</p>

<p>Where \(r_p\) and \(m_p\) are the radius and mass of a proton. Equating these two gives about the radius of a proton:</p>

<p>$$r_p=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{h}{cm_p}$$</p>

<p>The ancient Sumerians were responsible for giving us the unit of a second because they divided the earth’s rotation period, its day, into 24 hours, and the ancient Babylonians divided each hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, from the ancient Sumerians base 60 mathematics. Perhaps the most exciting entry in our galactic codex is:</p>

<p>$$\frac{L_{earth}}{\hbar_\odot}24=60$$</p>

<p>Where \(L_{earth}\) is the rotational angular momentum of the Earth. This specifies not only is the rotation period of the Earth best measured by dividing the day into 24 units and 60 units, but that such an optimization includes the mass and radius of the Earth. Another exciting entry in our galactic codex is that during the time in the Earth’s history when the day is about 24 hours which specifies close to a second from the kinetic energies of the Earth and Moon, the Moon perfectly eclipsing the Sun as seen from the Earth, holds:</p>

<p>$$\frac{r_{planet}}{r_{moon}}=\frac{R_{star}}{R_{moon}}$$</p>

<p>\(r_{planet}\) is the orbital radius of the Earth, \(r_{moon}\) is the orbital radius of the Moon, \(R_{star}\) is the radius of the Sun, and \(R_{moon}\) is the radius of the Moon. There is a lot more that we will find in the course of this paper regarding the exciting entries to be made in this Galactic Codex. We will even find, with astronomy being what it is today, that we can begin to make entries in the codex for other star systems. But of course, to really understand such star systems, we want to go to them, and survey them not just physically, but archaeologically.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in our radio astronomy search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) one of the transmissions we might receive might be not just the physical characteristics for their star and planet, but a Galactic Codex for many star systems. We even may be able to find traces of a galactic codex here on earth now, left in the ruins of archaeological sites. Such examples could be in clay Sumerian cuneiform tablets or in the megalithic yard which was perhaps a standard length used to construct megalithic sites, like Stonehenge. We will look at that, too, in this paper.</p>
