Entity Books publishes under a vast selection of genres but specializes in finding the common
structure between artificial intelligence (AI) and biological life, especially as a way of finding
the path by which biological life came into existence by looking at the path by which AI is formed.
Entity Books also publishes research in the study of UFOs and extraterrestrial life in the Cosmos.</p>

<p> It all started when I found a connection between the golden ratio and AI
    by way of the the central AI element silicon, Si, and the central doping agents
    phosphorus, P, and boron, B:</p>
    <p><img src="eqn_01.jpg" alt="equation 01"></p>
<p> Which can be written:</p>
    <p><img src="eqn_02.jpg" alt="equation 02"></p>
<p> And, of the central biological elements to the golden ratio conjugate:</p>
    <p><img src="eqn_03.jpg" alt="equation 03"></p>
<p> leading to the connection between artificial intelligence and the biological:</p>
    <p><img src="eqn_04.jpg" alt="equation 04"></p>
<p> And, can be written:<p/>
<p> <p><img src="eqn_05.jpg" alt="equation 05"></p>
<p> Writing in the arithmetic mean:</p>
<p> <p><img src="eqn_06.jpg" alt="equation 06"></p>
<p> Which is nice because:</p>
<p> <p><img src="eqn_07.jpg" alt="equation 07" width="600"></p>
<p> Where:</p>
    <p><img src="eqn_08.jpg" alt="equation 08" width="200"></p>
<p> Where ZnSe is zinc selenide, an intrinsic semiconductor used in AI
    and Ge is germanium, the other central AI element and,
    As is arsenic and Ga is gallium, the other two central doping agents</p>
<p> <p><img src="eqn_09.jpg" alt="equation 09" width="600"></p>
<p> A similar thing can be done with Germanium, Ge, and Gallium, Ga, and
    arsenic, As, this time using CHNOPS (C,H,N,O,P,S) the most abundant
    biological elements by mass:</p>
    <p><img src="eqn_10.jpg" alt="equation 10" width="600"></p>
<p> The factor by which our original equation has near-perfect equality
    uses H20, CH4, and NH3 water, methane, and ammonia, the primordial
    precursors to amino acids, the building blocks of biological life:</p> 
    <p><img src="eqn_11.jpg" alt="equation 11" width="600"></p>
    We find there is an equivalence to the precursors of the primordial AI
    and primordial biological life in that tungsten, W, is the filament of
    the first crude AI for making switches by housing it in silicon dioxide,
    SiO2, or glass for vacuum tubes:</p>

<p> It is now March 17, 2019 and I guess if the Universe is to be sublime, it should be elegant, exciting and, designed with sublime aesthetics, which is what I have always done in this project, and it has always panned out, that if</p>

<p> <p><img src="this.jpg" alt="this" width="600"></p>

<p> has perfection in the precursors of the amino acids as</p>

<p> <p><img src="this_02.jpg" alt="this_02" width="600"></p>

<p> Then,...</p>

<p> <p><img src="this_03.jpg" alt="this_03" width="600"></p>

<p>should have perfection for some aspect of biological components. Since Ga/Ge+As/Ge+1 is approximately three, and Ga/Si+As/Si+1 is approximately 6, it is in other things. One might hazard to guess, since the former is in the amino acids, the latter will be in the sugars and the monomer of the sugars, that are a big part of the biological, ribose, deoxyribose, glyceraldehyde, and formaldehyde used to make glyceraldehyde, ribose, and DNA and RNA, the instructions for biological life. It turns out it is:</p>

<p> <p><img src="sublime_02.jpg" alt="sublime_02" width="600"></p>

<p> Thus, where silicon is associated with the amino acids, germanium is associated with the DNA and RNA.</p>


<p> <p><img src="also.jpg" alt="also" width="600"></p>

<p> We talked about the primordial precursors to the amino acids and the precursors to the sugars of RNA and DNA
In their connection AI, but what about the amino acids themselves, the building blocks of life?</p>

<p> I had to invent a way to express the amino acids, and I did it like this</p>

<p> <p><img src="express_amino_acids.jpg" alt="express_amino_acids" width="200"></p>

<p> I processed the 20 amino acids with the above and found that two of them corresponded to elements and, they nicely were silicon (Si) and carbon (C) precisely the the two elements I wanted to compare, because they are the core elements of AI and organic life, respectively:</p>
