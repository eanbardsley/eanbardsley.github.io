I wrote this seguirillas (a structure in deep song from which flamenco is derived) as a variation on 2001 a space odyssey, for my website which is a continuation of the vision which Kubrick and Clarke had when they teamed up with NASA to make 2001 which is really based on a science fiction story written by Clarke called The Sentinel which appeared around 1950 in a 5 book science fiction anthology compiled by British literary figures around that time called Spectrum 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Robert Conquest and Kingsley Amis). The work appears in Spectrum Three which features stories by several sci fi writers based around the theme of optimism, many of them American. There is a good conversation in the Intro of Spectrum 4 between C.S. Lewis, Brian Aldiss, and Kingsley Amis where they discuss why science fiction is real literature because at the time many scholars in England thought it wasn't. They argued the value in Science Fiction is that you could create a planet for instance that had everything you needed to write a story you had in mind that the Earth didn't have.</p>
