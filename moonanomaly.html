<h1>Blue Ghost Finds Evidence In Support Of A Hollow Moon</h1>

<p>The Moon is very strange. It has an unusually low density, especially considering that it is a moon that belongs to a terrestrial planet, defying formation theories by accretion. What is more, the theory that it was the result of a large Mars-sized collision with the Earth is carrying less and less weight as recent missions to the Moon reveal its composition is wrong for such a scenario to be the case. That leaves the capture theory, that it was passing by the Earth and captured into an orbit around it. However, there is another possibility, and that is that the Moon is hollow to account for its low mass for its size. This is the hollow moon theory that is outside of the mainstream, but that actually accounts for the Moon’s anomalous nature easier than anything.</p>

<p>I wasn’t aware of the hollow moon theory until my own research led me to it (Vasin and Scherbakov, 1970) because I felt there was something pivotal about the Moon. And, there is, because we know it helps optimize the conditions for life on Earth by maintaining its tilt to its orbit around the Sun preventing temperature extremes and allowing for the seasons. I had developed a theory for a wave solution for the Earth/Moon/Sun system using the same wave equation we use to solve an electron orbiting around a proton in the hydrogen atom. Naturally in the quantum mechanics solution of the atom, the number of protons is a factor in the equation. When solving for the Earth orbiting the Sun, the solution naturally has to have the Sun in the equation for the solution. I found it does, but that the Sun’s size has to be described, or normalized, by the size of the Moon. This gives the Sun a size of 400, which is to say its radius is 400 lunar radii. I found the kinetic energy of the Earth orbiting the Sun as a solution to the wave equation is:</p>

<p>
\[
KE_e = \sqrt{n} \frac{R_\odot}{R_m} \cdot \frac{G^2 M_e^2 M_m^3}{2 \hbar_\odot^2}
\]
</p>

<p>Where \( M_e \) is the mass of the Earth, \( M_m \) is the mass of the Moon, and \( \hbar_\odot \) is my Planck-type constant for the Solar System. \( R_\odot \) is the radius of the Sun, and \( R_m \) is the radius of the Moon. This plays the role of \( Z \), the number of protons in an atom in the solution for the atom, which is:</p>

<p>
\[
E_n = -\frac{Z^2 (k_e e^2)^2 m_e}{2 \hbar^2 n^2}
\]
</p>

<p>I also found the ground state of the solar system, which I found interestingly gives a characteristic time of 1 second in our equations, is given by the mass of the moon cubed. The equation is:</p>

<p>
\[
\frac{\hbar_\odot^2}{G M_m^3} \cdot \frac{1}{c} = 1 \text{ second}
\]
</p>

<p>We see its similarity to the solution for the ground state orbit of a hydrogen atom which is:</p>

<p>
\[
r_1 = \frac{\hbar^2}{k e^2 m_e}
\]
</p>

<p>I further find we get the Earth’s current rotation period (day duration) of 24 hours if the characteristic time is about one second using the kinetic energy of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth compared to the Earth’s orbital kinetic energy. The equation is:</p>

<p>
\[
\frac{KE_m}{KE_e} \times \text{EarthDay} = 1.1 - 1.3 \text{ seconds}
\]
</p>

<p>Since we know how life on Earth evolves, but not how it got its start, one might suggest whatever was responsible for life on Earth was responsible for the Moon being there to make it work. Indeed they may have left their signature in that the Moon is the right size and distance from us to provide a nearly perfect eclipse of the Sun as seen from the Earth. The Moon’s orbit is growing ever so slowly, but it has been more or less what it is now since the arrival of anatomically modern humans 300,000 years ago. In fact, in my theory I use the condition of a perfect eclipse to solve star systems, because we know it works for ours. The equation is:</p>

<p>
\[
\frac{r_e}{r_m} = \frac{R_\odot}{R_m}
\]
</p>

<p>Which says the Earth orbital radius to the lunar orbital radius is equal to the solar radius to the lunar radius.</p>

<p>Recently, Blue Ghost, a lunar lander developed by Firefly that was launched on January 15, 2025, found evidence in support of the theory that the Moon may actually be hollow. It drilled several feet below its surface and, expecting to find the moon would be less dense the deeper you go, found that it was actually, to their surprise, more dense. If this is the case, a hollow moon theory would compensate for this high density.</p>

<p>This brings to mind a science fiction story by Arthur C. Clarke called <i>The Sentinel</i>. It was the precursor to the screenplay for the movie <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. In the story, we go to the Moon and the astronauts are exploring the terrain. They see in the distance atop a mountain a glistening metallic object. They climb the mountain and find a monolith. It was protected by a force field, and they blast the field to access it and study it. One astronaut says to the other, "Call Earth and tell them to expect visitors". By blasting the shield they severed contact of the monolith with its makers, and figured it was what they were supposed to do, to let them know we figured out how to go to the Moon, and were thus ready to make contact with another advanced life.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are supposed to go to the Moon to access its possibly hollow caverns where there may be computers that we can use to manipulate its orbit around the Earth and adjust the Earth climate when needed.</p>
